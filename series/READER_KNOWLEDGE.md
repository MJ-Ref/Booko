# Reader Knowledge Tracker

<!-- reviewed: 2026-02-13 -->

> Tracks what the reader knows at each book boundary.
> This file prevents two common series problems:
> (1) Over-explaining things the reader already knows from previous books.
> (2) Assuming the reader remembers details they may have forgotten between books.
>
> **Update this file at the end of each book's drafting process.**

## Why This Matters

Readers of book 2 should not need book 1 explained to them, but they also should not be expected to recall every detail from a book they read months or years ago. Meanwhile, new readers who pick up a later book need enough context to follow the story without being buried in backstory.

This tracker solves three problems:

1. **Re-introduction without info-dumping.** Knowing exactly what the reader knows allows natural re-introduction of key facts through action, dialogue, and brief context -- not through exposition paragraphs that bore returning readers.
2. **Spoiler prevention.** Knowing what has NOT been revealed prevents accidental spoilers for earlier books in a series.
3. **New reader accessibility.** If a book can be an entry point, this tracker defines the minimum knowledge a new reader needs.

## Knowledge State by Book Boundary

### After Book 01

| Category | What the Reader Knows | What the Reader Does NOT Know |
|----------|----------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Plot** | [Key events revealed in book-01] | [Mysteries still open, secrets still hidden] |
| **Characters** | [Characters introduced, relationships established, motivations shown] | [Unrevealed backstory, hidden identities, future characters] |
| **World** | [World rules established, locations visited, systems explained] | [Unexplored regions, hidden rules, unrevealed history] |
| **Mysteries** | [Questions raised and left open] | [Questions not yet raised] |

### After Book 02

| Category | What the Reader Knows | What the Reader Does NOT Know |
|----------|----------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Plot** | [Cumulative: book-01 + book-02 events] | [Remaining mysteries and unrevealed events] |
| **Characters** | [Updated character knowledge] | [Still-hidden character information] |
| **World** | [Updated world knowledge] | [Still-unexplored world elements] |
| **Mysteries** | [Mysteries resolved + new mysteries raised] | [Questions reserved for book-03] |

### After Book 03

| Category | What the Reader Knows | What the Reader Does NOT Know |
|----------|----------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Plot** | [Full series plot] | [Intentional ambiguities, if any] |
| **Characters** | [Complete character knowledge] | [Deliberate unknowns, if any] |
| **World** | [Full world picture] | [Intentional mysteries left for reader imagination] |
| **Mysteries** | [All major mysteries resolved] | [Minor threads left open by design] |

<!-- Add a section for each book boundary. -->

## Re-Introduction Guidelines

<!-- How to remind readers of key facts from previous books without info-dumping. -->

| Technique | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Action Re-Introduction** | Show the fact through a character's action | [Character touches their scar -- reminds reader of the injury from book-01 without narrating it] |
| **Dialogue Re-Introduction** | Let a character reference the fact naturally | ["You haven't been back since the fire" -- establishes both the fire and the character's absence] |
| **Brief Context Clause** | One subordinate clause of context | ["Mara, who had led the resistance since the fall of Keth, ..." -- reminds reader of two key facts in a clause] |
| **New Character's Perspective** | A new character learns about past events | [New character asks "what happened at Keth?" -- allows brief recap through dialogue] |

### Rules for Re-Introduction

1. **Never open a book with a summary of the previous book.** Trust the reader.
2. **Re-introduce facts through the first natural opportunity,** not in a block at the beginning.
3. **Spread re-introductions across the first three chapters.** Do not cluster.
4. **Prioritize re-introducing: (a) character relationships, (b) unresolved conflicts, (c) world rules.** In that order.
5. **Do not re-introduce facts the reader does not need.** If a detail from book-01 is irrelevant to book-02, leave it.

## New Reader Entry Points

<!-- Can a reader start at book 2, 3, etc.? What do they need? -->

| Entry Point | Viable? | Minimum Knowledge Needed | How Provided |
|-------------|---------|-------------------------|--------------|
| book-01 | Yes (series start) | None | N/A |
| book-02 | [Yes / No / Possible with caveats] | [List of essential facts from book-01] | [How book-02 provides this context: recap, natural exposition, or "read book-01 first"] |
| book-03 | [Yes / No / Possible with caveats] | [List of essential facts from books 01-02] | [How book-03 provides this context] |

<!-- If the series is strictly sequential, mark all entries after book-01 as "No" -->
<!-- and note "Sequential series -- each book requires the previous." -->

---

## Spoiler Sensitivity

<!-- What reveals in book N would spoil the experience of book N-1? -->

| Book | Contains Spoilers For | Spoiler Details | Handling |
|------|----------------------|-----------------|----------|
| book-02 | book-01 | [e.g., "Book-02 reveals the killer from book-01's mystery"] | [Unavoidable -- book-01 must be read first] |
| book-03 | book-01, book-02 | [e.g., "Book-03 references all major resolutions from earlier books"] | [Unavoidable -- sequential reading required] |

<!-- Use this table to determine reading order recommendations. -->
<!-- If book-03 spoils nothing from book-01, readers could potentially skip book-02. -->

## World Summary

<!-- This is not just a genre label. This is the FELT EXPERIENCE of your world.
     An agent writing chapter prose needs to internalize what it's like to EXIST here.
     Write this so that someone reading it could close their eyes and be there. -->

### First Impression

<!-- What hits a newcomer first? In Blade Runner it's the rain and the neon.
     In Middle-earth it's the scale and the age. This is the single strongest
     sensory/emotional impression of your world. -->

[Describe the first thing that strikes you when you step into this world -- a felt experience, not a list of facts. Example: "The heat is the first thing. Not dry heat -- wet, heavy, the kind that sits on your chest. Then the smell: salt and rotting kelp and engine oil. Then the sound of the harbor bells, which never stop, day or night."]

### Dominant Mood and Atmosphere

<!-- The baseline emotional register. Scenes can deviate, but this is what they return to. -->

[Describe the prevailing emotional atmosphere -- not the narrative tone, but the feeling the world radiates. Example: "A persistent sense of faded grandeur -- everything here was magnificent once and knows it. The people carry themselves with the dignity of a civilization that peaked three centuries ago."]

### Central Tension of the World

<!-- Every great setting has an inherent conflict baked into its structure.
     This tension should generate plot naturally. -->

[The fundamental conflict built into the world itself. Not the plot -- the condition the plot grows out of. Example: "The world runs on a resource that is slowly killing it. Everyone knows this. No one can stop using it."]

### How This World Differs from the Real World

<!-- For speculative fiction, name the rules that differ. For realistic fiction,
     name the lens or subculture. For nonfiction, name the organizing framework. -->

[Describe the key departure. Example: "This is the real world, but as experienced by long-haul truckers -- the geography is a network of highways and truck stops, cities exist only as skylines seen from the interstate, and time is measured in miles."]

---

## Geography and Physical World

<!-- Geography constrains everything: travel, trade, culture, warfare, agriculture.
     Fill this in with enough detail that a travel scene between two locations can
     be written without inventing new geography. -->

### Continental / Regional Overview

<!-- The spatial relationships between major regions. You do not need a detailed map. -->

[Describe the broad geography. How many continents, countries, regions, or territories matter to the series? How are they arranged relative to each other? Example: "Two landmasses separated by a narrow strait. The western continent is mountainous and forested. The eastern continent is flat steppe and river delta. The strait is only twelve miles wide but has treacherous currents -- crossing it is a major undertaking."]

### Climate Zones and Weather Patterns

<!-- Weather affects mood, pacing, wardrobe, travel, agriculture, and combat. -->

| Region | Climate Type | Seasonal Pattern | Weather That Matters for Plot |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------------------------------|
| [The Grasmere Lowlands] | [Temperate maritime -- mild, wet, grey] | [Mild winters, cool summers; rain 200+ days/year] | [Fog in autumn makes the marshes impassable; spring flooding isolates eastern villages for weeks] |
| [The Kharr Plateau] | [Arid continental -- extreme temperature swings] | [Scorching summers, bitter winters; two brief rainy weeks in spring] | [Summer heat halts midday travel; winter storms strand caravans; the spring rains trigger a brief, intense flowering that is culturally sacred] |
| [The Maren Coast] | [Tropical monsoon -- wet and dry seasons] | [Six months of daily downpours, six months of drought] | [The monsoon season makes naval warfare impossible; the dry season cracks the earth and dries the wells] |

### Natural Resources and Scarcity

<!-- Scarcity drives conflict. Abundance drives trade and envy. -->

| Resource | Where Found | Abundance | Who Controls It | Plot Significance |
|----------|------------|-----------|----------------|-------------------|
| [Blackite ore] | [Deep mines beneath the Kharr Plateau] | [Rare -- three known deposits, all heavily guarded] | [The Plateau Clans, who trade it at extortionate prices] | [Essential for forging the alloy used in the protagonist's weapon; supply disruption drives book-02 conflict] |
| [Freshwater] | [Abundant in the Lowlands; scarce everywhere else] | [The Lowlands have surplus; the Coast rations during dry season] | [Lowland river barons levy tolls on downstream users] | [Water rights dispute is the economic backdrop for the political alliance in book-01] |
| [Timber] | [Grasmere old-growth forests] | [Plentiful but slow to regenerate] | [Nominally crown land; practically, whoever has axes] | [Deforestation tension between builders and druids] |

### How Geography Shapes Culture

<!-- Mountain people differ from coast people, and the land is WHY. -->

[At least two examples of geography-to-culture causation. Example: "The Plateau Clans are insular because the only approach is through three narrow passes, each invaded at least once. Their architecture is defensive, their greetings include empty-hand rituals, and their word for 'stranger' is the same as their word for 'danger.' By contrast, the Maren Coast people are traders by necessity -- their land produces little food, so their culture values negotiation, multilingualism, and hospitality."]

### Key Geographic Features Affecting Plot

| Feature | Location | Physical Description | Plot Function |
|---------|----------|---------------------|---------------|
| [The Greywater Strait] | [Between the two continents] | [Twelve miles wide, vicious crosscurrents, perpetual fog bank at center] | [Natural barrier that keeps the continents politically separate; crossing it is a major plot event in book-02] |
| [Mount Ashen] | [Northern Kharr Plateau] | [Volcanic peak, dormant for 400 years, hot springs at base] | [Eruption is prophesied; the hot springs are a sacred site where the climax of book-03 occurs] |
| [The Marshwild] | [Eastern Grasmere Lowlands] | [Vast tidal marshland, treacherous footing, bioluminescent at night] | [Refuge for outlaws; the protagonist hides here in book-01; navigation requires local knowledge] |

### Travel Distances and Times

<!-- Critical for pacing. If two cities are three weeks apart by horse,
     a character cannot arrive the next day. -->

| From | To | Method | Distance | Travel Time | Hazards / Notes |
|------|----|--------|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| [Grasmere City] | [Portmaren] | [By road, horse] | [~180 miles] | [8-10 days in good weather; 14+ in rainy season] | [Road floods between mile markers 60-90 in autumn; bandit activity near the forest edge] |
| [Grasmere City] | [Portmaren] | [By river barge] | [~220 miles following the river] | [4-5 days downstream; 9-11 days upstream] | [Faster but expensive; barges do not run during spring floods] |
| [Portmaren] | [Kharr Hold] | [By sea then overland] | [~300 miles total] | [3 days sailing + 6 days climbing] | [Sea crossing only safe in summer; the mountain approach requires a guide] |

### Seasons and Their Effects on Daily Life

| Season | Duration | Weather | Effect on Daily Life | Cultural Significance |
|--------|----------|---------|---------------------|----------------------|
| [The Greening (Spring)] | [~2.5 months] | [Warming, heavy rains, flooding] | [Planting season; roads become mud; river traffic resumes] | [Festival of First Shoots; debts from winter are called in] |
| [The Bright (Summer)] | [~3 months] | [Warm, long days, occasional storms] | [Peak trade season; military campaigns; festivals] | [The longest day is a major holiday; marriages are traditionally held in this season] |
| [The Dimming (Autumn)] | [~2.5 months] | [Cooling, fog, shorter days] | [Harvest; preparation for winter; sea travel becomes dangerous] | [The harvest feast; honoring the dead at season's end] |
| [The Dark (Winter)] | [~4 months] | [Cold, snow in highlands, rain in lowlands] | [Travel slows; communities turn inward; stored food only] | [Storytelling season; the long night festival at midwinter] |

## Detailed Location Profiles

<!-- Duplicate this template for each significant location (major scenes happen here,
     a character's identity is shaped by it, or it embodies a thematic idea).
     Minor locations go in the summary table at the end of this section. -->

### [Location Name, e.g., Grasmere City]

**Overview**

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Type** | [City / Town / Village / Fortress / Wilderness / Building / Ship / etc.] |
| **Region** | [Which geographic region this belongs to] |
| **Population** | [Approximate, with a sense of density -- "crowded" vs. "sparse"] |
| **First Appears** | [book-01, CH-03] |
| **Primary Function in Series** | [Home base / Antagonist's stronghold / Site of climax / Symbolic space] |

**Physical Description**

<!-- Be specific enough that two different scenes set here will feel like the same place. -->

[Describe the physical space. Example: "Built on a hillside in concentric rings, governor's palace at the crown, docks at the base. Streets are narrow, cobbled, perpetually damp. Limestone buildings with slate roofs lean toward each other across the alleys. The market square is the only open space -- everything else is compressed, vertical."]

**Sensory Profile**

| Sense | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Sight** | [Dominant visual impressions. Example: "Grey stone, grey sky, grey water. The only color comes from the painted shop signs and the red-sailed fishing boats in the harbor."] |
| **Sound** | [What you hear. Example: "Gulls. Always gulls. The clatter of cart wheels on cobblestone. Harbor bells every quarter hour. At night, the sound of the tide against the seawall."] |
| **Smell** | [What you smell. Example: "Fish and brine near the docks; baking bread and coal smoke in the upper rings; incense near the temple quarter."] |
| **Touch / Feel** | [Physical sensations. Example: "The wind off the sea is constant and cuts through wool. The cobblestones are slick. Indoor spaces are warm but damp -- nothing ever fully dries."] |
| **Taste** | [If relevant. Example: "The salt air coats your lips. The local ale is dark and bitter. Street vendors sell fried whitebait on skewers."] |

**Atmosphere and Mood**

[What emotions does this place evoke? Example: "Claustrophobic but alive. Industry and ambition pressed into too-small a space. The vertical architecture makes you feel watched. But the market at midday has a raucous warmth. At night, the alleys are dark and the harbor creaks."]

**History of This Place**

[Key historical events that shaped this location. Example: "Founded as a fishing village 600 years ago. Became a trade port when the Strait route opened. Burned during the Succession War; rebuilt within the old walls rather than expanding, hence the compressed style. The palace was originally a fortress -- arrow slits still visible behind the facade."]

**Who Lives and Works Here**

[Demographics, occupations, social character. Example: "Majority working-class: dockworkers, fishers, craftspeople. Small aristocratic class in the upper rings. Significant foreign-trader population near the docks. A visible underclass in the sub-dock tunnels."]

**Social Dynamics Specific to This Location**

[How people interact HERE, which may differ from the broader culture. Example: "Class tension is geographic -- the higher up the hill, the higher the status, and everyone knows which ring you come from by your accent. The market square is the one place where rings mix. Foreign traders have their own quarter, creating resentment."]

**How This Location Changes Across the Series**

| Book | State of Location | Key Changes |
|------|------------------|-------------|
| [book-01] | [Prosperous but tense; political undercurrents] | [The market fire in CH-08 destroys the south quarter] |
| [book-02] | [Rebuilding; heightened security; foreign traders expelled] | [Occupation by northern forces in CH-12] |
| [book-03] | [Under occupation; resistance movement; atmosphere of fear] | [Liberation in CH-10; the city is scarred but free] |

**Key Scenes Set Here**

| Book | Chapter | Scene | Why This Location Matters to the Scene |
|------|---------|-------|---------------------------------------|
| [book-01] | [CH-03] | [Protagonist arrives for the first time] | [First impression establishes the world; the vertical city mirrors the social hierarchy the protagonist will navigate] |
| [book-01] | [CH-08] | [The market fire] | [The compressed architecture makes the fire catastrophic; the geography traps characters] |
| [book-03] | [CH-10] | [The liberation battle] | [The concentric-ring layout creates a siege-within-a-siege structure for the action] |

**Thematic Significance**

[What does this place represent? Example: "Grasmere City is civilization as compression -- ambition outgrowing the space available. Both the protagonist's home and her cage. The vertical hierarchy made literal in stone."]

### Location Summary Table

<!-- For locations that appear briefly or serve a single function, a row here suffices. -->

| Name | Region | First Appears | Brief Description | Function |
|------|--------|--------------|-------------------|----------|
| [The Roadside Shrine] | [Lowlands, mile 40 on the Grasmere-Portmaren road] | [book-01, CH-06] | [A weathered stone alcove with offerings of dried flowers; a single carved figure with worn features] | [Rest stop scene; protagonist's moment of doubt; establishes the folk religion] |
| [The Drowned Tower] | [Offshore, Maren Coast] | [book-02, CH-04] | [A half-submerged stone tower from a previous era; accessible only at low tide] | [Secret meeting location; symbolizes the buried past] |

## Cultures and Peoples

<!-- Culture is how a group answers "how should we live?" Fill each section with
     enough specificity that a character's cultural background visibly affects how
     they behave on the page. Duplicate this template for each distinct culture. -->

### [Culture Name, e.g., The Grasmere Lowlanders]

#### Naming Conventions

<!-- An agent generating a minor character name needs the PATTERN, not just examples. -->

| Element | Convention | Examples |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| **Given Names** | [Pattern and source. Example: "Nature-based, two syllables, soft consonants"] | [Alder, Brenna, Cael, Derry] |
| **Family Names** | [How family names work. Example: "Patronymic -- father's given name + 'son' or 'dah'"] | [Alderson, Brennadah, Caelson] |
| **Honorifics** | [Titles, forms of address. Example: "Elders are addressed as 'Root' + given name"] | [Root Alder, Root Brenna] |
| **Naming Ceremonies** | [When and how names are given] | [Named at the first new moon after birth; a second name earned at age-of-work (14)] |
| **Name Taboos** | [Names that cannot be used or are reserved] | [The names of the dead are not spoken for one full year after death] |

#### Language and Communication

<!-- Not just what language they speak, but HOW they use it. -->

- **Languages Spoken:** [Primary and secondary. Example: "Graspeak (common tongue); Old Root (liturgical, used in ceremonies); most merchants speak Trade Maren as a second language"]
- **Linguistic Texture:** [What the language sounds like, feels like. Example: "Graspeak is vowel-heavy and rhythmic -- it sounds like running water. Curses are whispered, never shouted. Compliments are indirect: you praise someone's tools, not their skill."]
- **Formality Levels:** [How speech changes with social context. Example: "Three registers: Hearth-talk (intimate, among family), Market-talk (polite, among equals), Ring-talk (formal, to superiors). Using the wrong register is a serious social error."]
- **Body Language Norms:** [What gestures mean. Example: "Eye contact is expected among equals but lowered eyes show respect to elders. Touching someone's hands without permission is intimate. Pointing with a finger is rude -- you gesture with an open palm."]
- **Common Expressions:** [Idioms, sayings, oaths that reveal cultural values. Example: "'Still water' = everything is fine. 'The river remembers' = actions have consequences. 'Drown me dry' = an expression of exasperation."]

#### Social Hierarchy and Mobility

- **Structure:** [Describe the hierarchy. Example: "Three tiers: River Families (old landholding clans), Market Folk (traders and skilled crafters), Mud Folk (laborers, recent immigrants, the displaced). The tiers are not legally enforced but are socially rigid."]
- **Basis of Status:** [What determines where you are. Example: "Land ownership, which is hereditary. You can gain market-folk status through wealth, but River Family status requires three generations of land tenure."]
- **Mobility:** [Can you move up or down? How? Example: "Upward mobility is possible but slow. Marriage into a higher tier is the fastest route but carries stigma. Downward mobility is sudden -- lose your land, lose your status."]
- **Visible Markers:** [How you can tell someone's status. Example: "River Families wear undyed linen (a mark of confidence -- they do not need to display wealth). Market Folk wear dyed clothing. Mud Folk wear whatever they have."]

#### Family Structure

[How kinship works. Example: "Extended family households of three generations are standard. The eldest woman manages the household; the eldest man manages external affairs. Children belong to the household, not just the parents -- orphans are absorbed, not institutionalized. Marriage is an economic alliance between households, arranged by the eldest women, though the couple can refuse. Divorce is permitted but returns all property to the original households."]

#### Gender and Identity

[How the culture constructs and understands gender. Example: "Binary gender system with strict role division: women manage interior spaces (home, temple, healing), men manage exterior spaces (fields, trade, defense). However, a third recognized category -- 'bridge-walkers' -- exists for those who move between roles, and they are considered lucky. Same-sex partnerships are accepted but not formalized through marriage; they exist in a social category called 'heart-kin.'"]

#### Daily Life

<!-- Vary by social position -- a laborer's day is not a noble's day. -->

| Social Position | Typical Day |
|----------------|-------------|
| [River Family member] | [Rise at dawn. Morning prayers at the household shrine. Breakfast with the full household. Oversee the estate -- tenant disputes, crop planning, correspondence. Midday meal is the main meal, taken formally. Afternoon is for visits, council meetings, or leisure. Evening meal is light. Household gathers for storytelling or music before bed.] |
| [Market Folk crafter] | [Rise before dawn. Open the workshop. Work through the morning with apprentices. Quick midday meal at the workbench. Afternoon: selling at market or filling orders. Close at sundown. Evening meal with family. One rest day per week, spent at the public baths and temple.] |
| [Mud Folk laborer] | [Rise in the dark. Walk to the docks or fields. Work until midday break -- bread and whatever is cheap. Work until sundown. Evening meal is communal, cooked in the shared courtyard. Entertainment is talk, dice, and song. Sleep comes fast.] |

#### Food and Drink

- **Staple Foods:** [What most people eat most days. Example: "River fish, root vegetables, dark bread, soft cheese. Meat is rare for Mud Folk, weekly for Market Folk, daily for River Families."]
- **Signature Dishes:** [Foods that define this culture. Example: "Marshpot -- a slow-cooked stew of whatever is available, always with fennel and river cress. Every household's recipe is different and fiercely defended."]
- **Meal Structure:** [When and how people eat. Example: "Three meals: dawn-bite (small, eaten standing), the Sitting (midday, the main meal, eaten together), and dusk-bowl (soup or porridge, informal). Eating alone is considered sad, not peaceful."]
- **Drink:** [What people drink. Example: "Small beer all day (the water is not reliable). River Families drink wine from the southern trade. Festival drink is mead made from marshflower honey."]
- **Food as Social Ritual:** [Example: "Offering food to a guest is the first act of hospitality. Refusing offered food is a grave insult. Poisoning a guest's food is the worst crime in Lowlander law -- worse than murder."]

#### Clothing and Appearance

- **Common Dress:** [What most people wear. Example: "Layered linen and wool. A long tunic belted at the waist, trousers or wrapped leggings, soft-soled boots. A hooded cloak for rain, which is most days."]
- **Status Markers in Dress:** [How clothing communicates position. Example: "Undyed linen = River Family. Dyed wool = Market Folk. Belt buckle material indicates guild membership. Hair worn long and braided for women; short for men except during mourning, when men let their hair grow."]
- **Practical Adaptations:** [How dress responds to environment. Example: "Everything is designed for wet weather. Oiled wool outer layers. Waterproof waxed-linen satchels. No one wears silk -- it rots in the damp."]

#### Art, Music, and Storytelling

[What cultural forms exist and what they reveal. Example: "Music is central. Every household has a singer. Instruments: a bowed string instrument (the wherl), hand drums, wooden flutes. Songs are narrative -- they tell stories of the river, the seasons, famous floods, historical figures. Singing is how history is transmitted. Visual art is secondary: carved wooden panels on buildings, woven tapestries in wealthy homes. Poetry is considered a form of prayer."]

#### Celebrations and Rituals

| Occasion | When | What Happens | Significance |
|----------|------|-------------|--------------|
| [Festival of First Shoots] | [First day of the Greening] | [Community planting of the ceremonial field; feasting; singing through the night; debts called in] | [Marks the new year; a time of renewal and accountability] |
| [The Binding] | [When two households agree to a marriage] | [Three-day celebration: first day, the households meet; second day, the exchange of gifts; third day, the couple walks the river path together] | [Marriage as alliance; the community witnesses and validates] |
| [The Dimming Feast] | [Last day of autumn] | [Harvest feast; the dead are honored by setting an empty place at the table; bonfires on the hilltops; the eldest tells the household's story for the year] | [Gratitude, remembrance, and the turning inward for winter] |
| [Age-of-Work] | [When a child turns 14] | [The child chooses a trade and receives a second name from their new master or mentor] | [Transition from childhood; identity is now partly self-chosen] |

#### Taboos and Forbidden Things

| Taboo | Consequence of Violation | Cultural Logic |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| [Speaking the name of the recently dead] | [Social shunning for the duration of the mourning year; believed to trap the spirit] | [The dead must be released, not held] |
| [Entering another household's kitchen uninvited] | [Equivalent to trespassing; can justify violence] | [The kitchen is the spiritual center of the household; it is inviolate] |
| [Cutting down a tree without planting two] | [Heavy fine; repeat offenders are exiled] | [The forest is the source of the river; destroying it destroys everything downstream] |

#### Death and Mourning

[How the culture handles death. Example: "The body is washed by the eldest household member and placed in a woven-reed boat, then sunk in the household's river-plot. Mourning lasts one year: the bereaved wear a black cord around the wrist, do not attend festivals, and do not speak the dead person's name. After the year, the cord is burned and the name can be spoken again."]

#### Education and Knowledge

- **How Children Learn:** [Example: "Until age-of-work (14), children are educated by the household -- elders teach history through songs, practical skills are learned by doing. Formal schools do not exist. Literacy is common among River Families, functional among Market Folk, rare among Mud Folk."]
- **Valued Knowledge:** [What the culture considers worth knowing. Example: "River knowledge: weather reading, water levels, soil quality. Practical craft skills. Historical songs. Theological knowledge is respected but considered the province of the temple."]
- **Restricted Knowledge:** [What is hidden or forbidden. Example: "Old Root language is taught only to temple initiates. Certain songs are restricted to the eldest of each household. Knowledge of the deep-marsh paths is closely guarded by the families who live there."]

#### Attitudes Toward Outsiders

[How the culture receives strangers. Example: "Hospitable but watchful. A stranger is fed and housed for three days without questions -- sacred law. On the fourth day, they must state their business or leave. Long-term outsiders are gradually accepted but never fully trusted -- the phrase 'dry-footed' (someone not born near the river) persists even for outsiders who have lived here for decades."]

<!-- REPEAT this entire cultural template for each distinct culture. -->

---

## Political Systems

<!-- How power actually works -- not just the official structure, but the informal reality. -->

### Structure of Governance

[Describe the political system -- both the official structure and the informal reality. Example: "Nominally a constitutional monarchy: the Crown rules, advised by the Council of Rivers. In practice, the Crown has been weak for two generations, and the Council governs by consensus -- or by the loudest voice. The Maren Coast operates as an independent trade republic. The Kharr Plateau clans recognize no outside authority."]

### Who Holds Power and How They Got It

| Power Holder | Title / Role | Basis of Power | How They Acquired It |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|---------------------|
| [Seren Alderson] | [Queen, Crown of Grasmere] | [Hereditary right; diminished by two generations of weak rulers] | [Inherited at age 19 after father's death; widely seen as a figurehead] |
| [The Council of Rivers] | [Advisory body, de facto legislature] | [Land ownership; economic control of river trade] | [Seats are hereditary, tied to land grants from the founding era] |
| [The Portmaren Trade Guild] | [No formal political role; enormous informal power] | [Wealth from sea trade; control of the harbor] | [Grew from a merchant cooperative; now effectively governs the coast] |

### How Power Is Transferred

[How power changes hands. Example: "The Crown passes to the eldest child regardless of gender. If no heir exists, the Council elects a new monarch -- this has happened twice, both times causing civil conflict. Council seats pass with the land. The Trade Guild's leadership is elected every five years, but the elections are controlled by the three wealthiest families."]

### Resistance and Opposition

| Opposition Group | What They Oppose | Methods | Strength |
|-----------------|-----------------|---------|----------|
| [The Mud Folk Collective] | [The River Family land monopoly] | [Work stoppages, petitions, occasional sabotage of irrigation works] | [Numerous but disorganized; no formal leadership; growing anger] |
| [The Kharr Isolationists] | [Any lowland influence on Plateau affairs] | [Closing the mountain passes; refusing trade; border raids] | [Militarily capable but economically dependent on lowland grain] |
| [The Reformist Faction within the Council] | [The Council's own corruption and stagnation] | [Political maneuvering; alliances with the Crown; public speechmaking] | [Small but growing; their leader is charismatic and has the Queen's ear] |

### Laws and Enforcement

- **Legal System:** [How justice works. Example: "Laws are set by the Council of Rivers and enforced by Crown Wardens -- a military police force loyal to the Crown. Trials are conducted by a panel of three Wardens. For serious crimes, the accused can demand a Council Hearing, but this costs money most people do not have."]
- **Key Laws That Affect the Plot:** [Example: "The Trespass of Kitchens law makes home invasion a capital offense. The Debtor's Tide law allows creditors to seize a debtor's household and sell the members into indentured labor. The Stranger's Three Days law protects visitors but also means harboring an undeclared guest past three days is a crime."]
- **Fairness and Corruption:** [Is the system just? Example: "The system is formally fair and practically biased. River Families rarely face serious charges. Mud Folk are convicted on thinner evidence and punished more harshly. Crown Wardens are underpaid and widely known to accept bribes. The protagonist's first act of rebellion is refusing to enforce an unjust Debtor's Tide order."]

### Corruption and Its Forms

[What corruption looks like here. Example: "Bribery is so normalized it has its own euphemism: 'oiling the lock.' Council members trade votes for trade concessions. The system functions because everyone participates -- the corruption IS the system. The danger is not one corrupt individual but a structure that requires corruption to operate."]

### Alliances and Rivalries Between Power Centers

| Relationship | Nature | Basis | Stability |
|-------------|--------|-------|-----------|
| [Crown <-> Council of Rivers] | [Uneasy codependence] | [Crown needs Council's economic support; Council needs Crown's legitimacy] | [Fragile; will shatter if either side finds an alternative] |
| [Council of Rivers <-> Trade Guild] | [Rivalry masked as partnership] | [Both want economic control; the Guild is richer but lacks political legitimacy] | [Deteriorating; the Guild is pushing for Council seats] |
| [Crown <-> Kharr Clans] | [Mutual hostility, occasional negotiation] | [The Crown claims sovereignty; the Clans laugh at the claim] | [Stable in its instability; neither side can afford open war] |

### How Politics Affects Ordinary People

[Example: "For Mud Folk, politics means the price of bread and which Wardens take bribes. For Market Folk, it means trade regulations and harbor tolls. For River Families, politics is daily life -- every meal is a negotiation, every marriage an alliance."]

---

## Economy and Resources

<!-- A reader can forgive magic they don't understand but not economics that make no sense. -->

### Currency and Exchange

[Describe how trade works. Example: "Coined currency: the River Crown (silver), the Half-Crown, and the Penny (copper, 20 to a Crown). Gold Crowns exist but are rare. Barter is common in rural areas and on the Kharr Plateau. The Maren Coast uses its own currency (the Tidal Mark) but accepts River Crowns at a fluctuating exchange rate."]

### Key Industries and Trade Goods

| Industry / Good | Where | Who Benefits | Economic Role |
|----------------|-------|-------------|---------------|
| [River fishing] | [Grasmere Lowlands] | [All tiers -- it is the baseline food supply] | [Subsistence and local trade; not an export good] |
| [Blackite ore mining] | [Kharr Plateau] | [Plateau Clans (extraction); Lowland smiths (refining)] | [The most valuable trade good in the world; source of Plateau wealth and leverage] |
| [Sea trade / shipping] | [Maren Coast] | [Trade Guild; foreign merchants] | [The engine of coastal wealth; connects the world to outside economies] |
| [Textile production] | [Grasmere Market Folk] | [Weavers' guild; dye merchants] | [Major export; Grasmere cloth is prized for quality] |

### Wealth Distribution

[Who has money and who does not. Example: "A River Family elder: 10,000 Crowns in land. A Market Folk crafter: 500 Crowns over a lifetime. A Mud Folk laborer: 2-3 Crowns per week, no savings. The gap is vast and growing -- this economic tension underlies the political instability."]

### What Things Cost

<!-- An agent writing a scene where a character buys a meal or pays for passage needs these. -->

| Item / Service | Cost | Context |
|---------------|------|---------|
| [A day's meals for one person] | [4-6 Pennies] | [Street food or tavern fare; a household's own food costs less] |
| [A night at a decent inn] | [8-12 Pennies] | [Includes a private room and morning meal; a common-room bed is 3 Pennies] |
| [A river barge passage, Grasmere to Portmaren] | [3 River Crowns] | [Deck passage; a private cabin is 8 Crowns] |
| [A good horse] | [15-25 River Crowns] | [A working horse; a war-trained horse is 50+] |
| [A sword, standard quality] | [8-12 River Crowns] | [A blackite-alloy blade is 50+ Crowns and must be commissioned] |
| [A Mud Folk laborer's weekly wage] | [2-3 River Crowns] | [For context: a laborer works a full month to buy a horse] |

### Economic Pressures Driving Plot

[What economic forces create story tension. Example: "The Kharr Clans have raised blackite prices three times in five years. The Lowlands cannot keep buying at these rates, but their military technology depends on the alloy. This drives the Crown to consider an alliance with the Trade Guild -- political concessions for economic relief. Meanwhile, the Mud Folk bear the cost through wage stagnation, which is why the Collective is growing."]

## Religion, Mythology, and Cosmology

<!-- Belief shapes how characters interpret events and make decisions. Even secular
     characters in a religious world are shaped by the religion they reject. -->

### What People Believe About How the World Works

[The dominant cosmology. Example: "Most Lowlanders believe the world is a living thing -- the River is its blood, the soil its flesh. This is literal truth to them. The Kharr Clans believe the world is a machine built by a departed god. The Maren Coast traders are secular -- they believe in luck, skill, and the market."]

### Creation Stories and Origin Myths

[The culture's story of how the world began. Example: "The world was a single vast river. The river dreamed, and the dream became land. The first people rose from the riverbed like reeds. The river still dreams -- violent dreams bring floods, gentle dreams bring harvest. Human purpose is to sing so its dreams stay gentle."]

### Gods, Spirits, and Supernatural Entities

| Entity | Domain | Nature | How Worshipped | Role in Series |
|--------|--------|--------|---------------|----------------|
| [The River-That-Dreams] | [The living world itself; water, growth, cycles] | [Not a person -- a presence. It does not speak or have a face. It is felt.] | [Songs sung at the water's edge; offerings of food placed on floating reed-boats; the temple mediates between people and the River] | [The protagonist's growing connection to the River is a spiritual arc across the series; whether it is real or symbolic is deliberately ambiguous] |
| [The Hollow King] | [Death, endings, the space between; a Kharr belief] | [The departed god who built the world and then left; he waits at the center of the mountain] | [The Clans do not worship him -- they appease him. Offerings of ore are left in deep shafts.] | [The antagonist believes the Hollow King can be called back; this drives the book-03 conflict] |
| [Marsh-lights] | [The dead; memory; deception] | [Bioluminescent phenomena in the Marshwild that Lowlanders believe are the spirits of the drowned] | [Not worshipped; avoided. Speaking to them is forbidden.] | [The protagonist follows one in book-01 and discovers the hidden path -- is it a spirit or just gas?] |

### Religious Practices

- **Daily Practice:** [Example: "A brief song at dawn, facing the nearest body of water. A drop of the first drink of the day poured on the ground. Nothing elaborate -- religion here is woven into daily rhythms, not confined to special occasions."]
- **Temple Practice:** [Example: "The Temple of the River is a formal institution: trained singers, a hierarchy of interpreters, a body of theological texts. Temple services happen at the new and full moon. The temple collects tithes and administers charity. It is respected but not universally loved -- many Lowlanders consider it an unnecessary intermediary."]
- **Sacrifice and Offering:** [Example: "Food offerings on reed-boats, released into the current. At the Dimming Feast, a portion of the harvest is returned to the river. Animal sacrifice does not exist; the idea is horrifying to Lowlanders. The Kharr Clans, by contrast, practice blood offerings -- a cut palm, blood dripped onto stone."]

### Religious Institutions and Their Power

[How organized religion functions as a political force. Example: "The Temple is the largest landowner after the River Families. The First Singer has a Council seat. The Temple runs the only formal schools and hospitals, giving it enormous soft power. It supports the Crown but has its own agenda: expanding influence over the Kharr Plateau, where its theology is rejected."]

### Skeptics and Heretics

[Who does not believe, and what happens to them. Example: "Skepticism is more common in cities. It is tolerated if quiet -- open mockery is socially punished but not criminally prosecuted. True heresy -- claiming the River is dead -- is rarer and more dangerous. No formal inquisition, but heretics find their businesses struggling and their neighbors unfriendly."]

### How Religion Intersects with Magic / Technology / Science

[If applicable. Example: "Whether the River-That-Dreams is real is the series' central spiritual ambiguity. The Temple claims all phenomena as evidence; skeptics claim natural explanations. The series lets both readings coexist."]

---

## Systems

<!-- Rule-governed structures (magic, technology, etc.) with internal logic the
     narrative must respect. Duplicate this template for each system. -->

### [System Name, e.g., The River's Dreaming (Magic / Supernatural System)]

**Core Mechanic**

[Describe how the system works at its most fundamental level. Example: "Certain people -- Listeners -- can hear the River's dreaming: a low hum carrying impressions and emotions. By concentrating, a Listener senses the natural world within about a mile. With effort, they can push intent into the hum -- encouraging growth, calming water. This is persuasion, not command. The River can refuse."]

**Source of Power**

[Where the ability comes from. Example: "Unknown. The Temple claims a divine gift. Skeptics note it correlates with family lines and proximity to deep water. The Kharr Clans have Bone Readers who listen to the mountain instead -- suggesting the ability is not unique to the Lowlands."]

**How It Is Learned**

[Example: "Listeners are identified in childhood -- they report hearing a hum others cannot. The Temple trains them in a seven-year apprenticeship. Untrained Listeners suffer headaches and anxiety. A few are self-taught, which the Temple views with suspicion."]

**Costs and Limits**

- **Physical Cost:** [Example: "Extended Listening causes exhaustion, nosebleeds, and in extreme cases, seizures. A Listener who pushes too hard can lose the ability temporarily or permanently."]
- **Mental Cost:** [Example: "The hum never stops. Listeners must learn to filter it or it overwhelms their own thoughts. Long-term Listeners report difficulty distinguishing their own emotions from the River's. Some lose their sense of self."]
- **Hard Limits:** [Example: "Cannot affect dead matter. Cannot control people -- only sense them. Range of about one mile. Does not function in the Kharr Mountains. Cannot predict the future."]
- **What It Absolutely Cannot Do:** [Example: "Raise the dead. Control minds. Create matter. See the future. Work through thick stone."]

**Social Perception of Practitioners**

[Example: "Respected but slightly feared. Valued for predicting floods and diagnosing crop diseases, but people are uneasy around someone who senses emotions. Listeners often live at the edge of communities."]

**History of the System**

[Example: "Listening has existed as long as oral history. Historical accounts suggest it was more powerful in the past. Whether this is myth or genuine decline is debated -- the Temple blames weakening faith; skeptics say the old accounts are exaggerated."]

**Edge Cases and Gray Areas**

[Example: "Can a Listener sense through the Greywater Strait? Unclear -- salt water may disrupt the hum. Can Listeners and Bone Readers communicate? One historical account suggests yes, never replicated. What happens in the Marshwild? The hum becomes chaotic -- voices instead of impressions. The Temple forbids it."]

**Interaction with Other Systems**

[Example: "Listening and Bone Reading appear to be related phenomena on different frequencies. Technology does not interact with Listening. However, blackite ore muffles the hum; Listeners report discomfort in the mines."]

**Rules Summary**

1. [Listeners sense the living natural world within ~1 mile]
2. [They persuade, never command; the River can refuse]
3. [Extended use causes physical and mental deterioration]
4. [Cannot affect the dead, control minds, or predict the future]
5. [Does not function in the Kharr Mountains]
6. [Blackite ore muffles the ability]
7. [Established in: book-01, CH-04 (basic rules); book-01, CH-11 (limits); book-02, CH-06 (edge cases)]

## Organizations and Factions

<!-- Duplicate this template for each significant faction. -->

### [Organization Name, e.g., The Temple of the River]

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Symbols** | [Visual identity. Example: "A spiral of blue thread, representing the river's current. Worn as a badge on the left shoulder."] |
| **Motto / Creed** | [Example: "We sing so the River dreams gently."] |
| **Founded** | [Example: "Approximately 400 years ago, when the first formal temple was built at the river's source."] |
| **Headquarters** | [Example: "The Source Temple, at the headwaters of the Grasmere River."] |

**Goals**

- **Stated Goal:** [What they say they want. Example: "To maintain the relationship between the people and the River-That-Dreams through song, interpretation, and guidance."]
- **Actual Goal:** [What they really want, which may differ. Example: "To expand Temple influence, consolidate control over Listener training, and extend their theology to the Kharr Plateau -- partly out of genuine belief, partly because the Plateau's ore wealth would fund their ambitions."]

**Membership**

- **Who Joins:** [Example: "Children identified as Listeners are recruited at age 8-10. Non-Listeners can join as support staff (scribes, healers, administrators). The Temple also attracts true believers, political refugees, and those seeking education."]
- **How You Join:** [Example: "Listeners are invited. Others petition and are accepted at the First Singer's discretion. There is a one-year novitiate."]
- **How You Leave:** [Example: "Officially, you can leave at any time. Practically, leaving is socially costly -- former Temple members are viewed with suspicion. Listeners who leave are monitored; the Temple does not like untrained or unaligned Listeners."]

**Internal Hierarchy**

[Describe the power structure. Example: "First Singer (supreme authority) -> Circle of Voices (seven senior advisors) -> Full Singers (trained Listeners) -> Novice Singers -> Temple Staff (non-Listeners). Meritocratic in theory; in practice, First Singers come from the same three families."]

**Resources and Power**

[What gives them influence. Example: "Land (second-largest landowner), a monopoly on Listener training, the only formal schools, the only hospitals, moral authority with the common people, and a seat on the Council of Rivers."]

**Allies and Enemies**

| Ally / Enemy | Relationship | Basis |
|-------------|-------------|-------|
| [The Crown] | [Ally, with reservations] | [The Temple legitimizes the Crown; the Crown protects the Temple. But the Crown resents Temple influence and the Temple considers the Crown weak.] |
| [The Kharr Clans] | [Enemy] | [The Temple wants to extend its theology to the Plateau. The Clans consider this cultural imperialism.] |
| [The Mud Folk Collective] | [Complicated] | [The Temple provides charity to Mud Folk and is genuinely respected. But the Collective sees the Temple as part of the power structure they oppose.] |

**Secrets**

[Example: "The Temple knows that Listening is declining -- each generation produces fewer Listeners. The theological explanation (weakening faith) is a cover: the River's hum is genuinely growing fainter. Something is wrong with the River itself. Only the First Singer and Circle of Voices know."]

**How They Evolve Across the Series**

| Book | State | Key Changes |
|------|-------|-------------|
| [book-01] | [Powerful, stable, paternalistic] | [The protagonist's conflict with the Temple over Listener independence begins] |
| [book-02] | [Shaken by the revelation of the declining hum; internal factions form] | [A reformist faction within the Temple allies with the protagonist] |
| [book-03] | [Split between traditionalists and reformists; forced to confront the truth about the River] | [The Temple is transformed -- smaller, humbler, but more honest] |

---

## Calendar, Time, and Seasons

<!-- If your world uses a non-standard calendar, define it here for consistent dating. -->

### Calendar System

[Describe how time is measured. Example: "The Lowlander calendar has four seasons of unequal length (the Dark is longest), twelve months of 30 days each, and a five-day intercalary festival (the Turning) between the end of the Dark and the start of the Greening. Years are counted from the founding of Grasmere City. The current year is 612."]

### Important Dates and Holidays

| Date | Name | Significance | Observed By |
|------|------|-------------|-------------|
| [1st of the Greening] | [Festival of First Shoots] | [New year; planting; debt-calling] | [All Lowlanders] |
| [Midsummer, the Bright] | [Longest Day] | [Peak celebration; marriages; trade fairs] | [All Lowlanders; the Maren Coast holds a parallel sea-festival] |
| [Last day of the Dimming] | [The Dimming Feast] | [Harvest; honoring the dead] | [All Lowlanders; the Kharr Clans have a similar observance] |
| [Midwinter, the Dark] | [The Long Night] | [Storytelling; community; endurance] | [All Lowlanders] |
| [The five days between the Dark and the Greening] | [The Turning] | [Outside normal time; debts are suspended; social rules relax; a liminal, carnival period] | [All Lowlanders; the Temple disapproves but cannot stop it] |

### Time Perception and Cultural Attitudes

[How the culture relates to time. Example: "Lowlanders do not have clocks. Time is measured by the sun, tides, and harbor bells. Punctuality is loose; rushing is considered rude. The Maren Coast traders, by contrast, use sand-glasses and exact intervals, because tides wait for no one. This difference in time-perception is a source of mutual irritation."]

---

## Flora and Fauna

<!-- Only species that matter: daily life, key scenes, symbolic weight, or constraints.
     Not an encyclopedia -- just what an agent needs to write a walk through the landscape. -->

### Key Animal Species

| Species | Habitat | Role in Human Life | Plot / Symbolic Significance |
|---------|---------|-------------------|------------------------------|
| [Greymarch eels] | [The Grasmere River and tributaries] | [Primary protein source for Lowlanders; eel fishing is a major occupation] | [The eels migrate seasonally; their arrival marks the start of prosperity. When the eels fail to come in book-02, it signals something is wrong with the River.] |
| [Stonebacks (mountain goats)] | [Kharr Plateau] | [Domesticated for milk, meat, and wool; essential to Clan survival] | [A gift of stonebacks is the highest honor among the Clans; the protagonist receives one in book-02 as a sign of acceptance.] |
| [Marshwild herons] | [Eastern Lowlands marshes] | [Wild; not hunted (considered sacred)] | [Herons appear in scenes of stillness and transition; associated with the dead and with Listening.] |

### Key Plant Life

| Species | Habitat | Use | Significance |
|---------|---------|-----|-------------|
| [Marshflower] | [Wetlands, riverbanks] | [Honey production; medicinal (antiseptic); ceremonial] | [Marshflower honey is used in the Festival of First Shoots mead; the flowers are placed on graves; their scent is associated with both celebration and death.] |
| [Ironwood] | [Old-growth Grasmere forests] | [Construction; shipbuilding; tool handles] | [Ironwood is slow-growing and over-harvested; the tension between builders and conservationists is a background conflict.] |
| [Bitter root] | [Kharr Plateau, high altitude] | [Stimulant when chewed; brewed as a harsh tea] | [Every Plateau scene should mention this; it is as culturally ubiquitous as coffee.] |

### Ecosystem Relationships

[Connections that matter for the story. Example: "The greymarch eels depend on clean water and marshflower reed beds for spawning. Deforestation upstream increases silt, damages the reed beds, and reduces eel spawning. This ecological chain is the scientific explanation for the decline in book-02 -- whether characters accept it or the theological explanation is a key tension."]

---

## Sensory Palette

<!-- The world's color grading, sound design, and texture map. Agents pull from
     this palette for atmospheric details that feel right without contradicting
     established descriptions. -->

### Dominant Colors

[The visual palette of the world. Example: "Greys and greens and browns. Stone-grey, river-grey, cloud-grey. The green of moss, marshgrass, forest canopy. The brown of mud, wet wood, oiled leather. Color stands out sharply against this muted backdrop: the red of the fishing-boat sails, the blue of Temple thread, the gold of marshflowers in bloom. The Kharr Plateau breaks the palette -- it is a world of black rock, white snow, and the deep amber of firelight in stone halls."]

### Common Sounds

| Environment | Sound Palette |
|-------------|--------------|
| [Urban -- Grasmere City] | [Cart wheels on wet cobblestone. The overlapping voices of the market. Gulls. Harbor bells. The slap of river water against stone quays. At night: the creak of ships, distant singing from taverns, the watch-call every hour.] |
| [Rural -- Lowland countryside] | [Wind in marshgrass. Birdsong -- larks in the morning, nightjars at dusk. The croak of frogs. Distant sheep. The slow creak of a watermill. Silence that is not silence -- the hum of a living landscape.] |
| [Wilderness -- the Marshwild] | [Water. Everything is water: dripping, gurgling, lapping. The sucking sound of mud. The sudden clatter of a heron taking flight. At night, the marsh is loud with insects and, some say, with whispers.] |
| [The Kharr Plateau] | [Wind. Constant, thin, high-altitude wind. The distant ring of hammer on stone from the mines. Stoneback goats bleating. Echoes -- sound carries strangely in the mountain passes.] |

### Defining Smells

| Location / Context | Smells |
|-------------------|--------|
| [Grasmere City] | [Fish and brine near the docks; coal smoke and baking bread in the upper rings; wet wool everywhere; incense in the Temple quarter; the sour-sweet smell of the tannery district.] |
| [The Lowland countryside] | [Wet earth. Cut grass. River water -- which has its own smell, green and mineral. Woodsmoke from farmhouses. The sharp sweetness of marshflower in season.] |
| [The Kharr Plateau] | [Cold stone. Bitter root tea. Goat. The metallic tang near the mines. The clean, empty smell of altitude.] |

### Textures and Physical Sensations

[What the world feels like against the skin. Example: "Damp. The Lowlands are perpetually damp -- clothing never fully dries, stone walls weep. The wind off the sea pushes against you. The Kharr Plateau is the opposite: dry, sharp, cold air that stings the lungs. The Maren Coast: heat, salt-grit on skin, sticky humidity."]

### How the Sensory Palette Shifts Across the Series

| Book | Sensory Shift |
|------|--------------|
| [book-01] | [The world as it normally is: muted, damp, alive. The palette is grey-green-brown. Sounds are natural and rhythmic.] |
| [book-02] | [The eels fail; the marshflowers do not bloom; the River's hum fades. The palette desaturates. Silences appear where there should be sound. The world feels like it is holding its breath.] |
| [book-03] | [Conflict: fire, iron, shouts. The palette sharpens -- reds and blacks intrude. After the resolution, color returns slowly, like spring after an unnatural winter.] |

---

## Constraints

<!-- Hard boundaries. Removing a constraint requires an EDR. -->

| Constraint | Reason | Established In | Consequences if Violated |
|-----------|--------|----------------|------------------------|
| [The dead cannot be brought back by any means] | [Preserves the stakes of every death; prevents "death is cheap" syndrome] | [book-01, CH-11 -- stated explicitly by the First Singer] | [Every death scene loses its weight; the entire mourning culture becomes pointless] |
| [Listening cannot control human minds or behavior] | [Keeps the protagonist sympathetic; prevents easy solutions to social conflicts] | [book-01, CH-04 -- the protagonist tries and fails] | [Every political and interpersonal conflict in the series could be solved by mind control; all tension collapses] |
| [Blackite ore is finite and cannot be synthesized] | [Preserves the scarcity-driven political tension between the Lowlands and the Plateau] | [book-01, CH-07 -- established through world-building dialogue] | [The economic conflict driving book-02 has no stakes if blackite can be manufactured] |
| [No character can survive the Greywater Strait crossing without a ship] | [Makes the strait a genuine barrier; prevents convenient travel between continents] | [book-01, CH-01 -- described as a death sentence] | [The strait loses its function as a geographic and narrative barrier] |
| [The Temple cannot compel anyone to join or remain] | [Keeps the Temple morally complex rather than cartoonishly evil] | [book-01, CH-06 -- a novice leaves freely] | [The Temple becomes a prison and the political nuance of the series simplifies to good-vs-evil] |

## World Evolution

<!-- The world is not a backdrop -- it is a character. Track its changes so agents
     writing later books know what the world looks like NOW. -->

### Series-Wide Arc of the World

[The world's transformation in one paragraph. Example: "The world begins in fragile equilibrium -- prosperous but built on unsustainable extraction. Across the series, the equilibrium collapses: the River weakens, the economy fractures, alliances shatter. The resolution is not a return to the old balance but the construction of a new one -- less prosperous, less certain, but more honest."]

### By-Book World State

| Book | World State at Start | Key Changes During Book | World State at End | Sensory / Atmospheric Shift |
|------|---------------------|------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| [book-01] | [Fragile prosperity; political tension simmering; the River's decline has begun but is not yet noticed by most] | [The protagonist discovers the decline; the market fire exposes political corruption; the Kharr Clans close a mountain pass] | [Prosperity is visibly fraying; fear is entering the public mood; the first refugees from the eastern lowlands arrive in Grasmere City] | [The world feels slightly off -- as if the colors are fading at the edges. Something is wrong, but you cannot quite name it.] |
| [book-02] | [Economic stress; the eel migration fails; political factions harden] | [Open conflict between the Crown and the Council; the Maren Coast declares trade independence; the River's hum fades noticeably] | [The old political order has collapsed; the Lowlands are fragmenting; the world feels emptier, quieter, more fragile] | [The silence is the dominant sensory change. The River is quiet. The marshes are still. The harbor bells sound hollow.] |
| [book-03] | [Crisis: political collapse, ecological decline, military conflict] | [The truth about the River is revealed; the factions must cooperate or perish; the protagonist makes a sacrifice that costs her] | [The River's hum returns, faintly. The political structure is new and untested. The world is scarred but alive.] | [Sound returns. Not the old sounds -- new ones. The world is the same landscape with a different song.] |

---

## By Book Type

<!-- Fill in the section that matches your series type. Delete or collapse the others. -->

### Fiction -- Worldbuilding

- **Genre Conventions This World Meets:** [What genre expectations does this world satisfy? Example: "Secondary-world fantasy: distinct cultures, supernatural ability, political conflict. The ecology-focused worldbuilding is a distinguishing feature."]
- **Genre Conventions This World Subverts:** [Where does the world break expectations? Example: "No Dark Lord. No prophecy. Magic is subtle. The resolution comes through political negotiation, not a final battle."]
- **The World's Thematic Argument:** [What does the world argue about reality? Example: "That systems matter more than individuals. That ecological collapse is a political choice. That listening is the most radical act of power."]
- **What the World Would Look Like as a Travel Poster:** [What is appealing about this world? This reveals what keeps readers turning pages. Example: "Come to the Grasmere Lowlands: where the mist rises off the river at dawn and the songs of the River-singers carry across the water at dusk."]

### Nonfiction -- Domain / Field Context

- **Field:** [e.g., cognitive psychology, software engineering, economics, history]
- **State of the Field at Series Start:** [Current consensus, active debates. Example: "The field is in a crisis of replication. Two camps: those defending original findings and those calling for methodological overhaul."]
- **Key Frameworks and Models:** [Theoretical structures the series builds on. Example: "Dual-process theory; embodied cognition; the predictive processing framework."]
- **Intellectual Landscape and Rivalries:** [Major thinkers and fault lines. Example: "The Kahneman camp vs. the Gigerenzer camp. The WEIRD-population critique."]
- **How the Field Changes Across the Series:** [Example: "Between book-01 and book-03, new technology shifts the debate and the author's position evolves."]
- **Jargon and Language Guide:** [Key terms defined for consistency. Example: "'Heuristic' -- always used in the Gigerenzer sense (adaptive shortcut), not the Kahneman sense (cognitive bias)."]

### Memoir -- Historical / Cultural Setting

- **Era and Its Character:** [Not just dates but what the era FELT like. Example: "1970s Detroit. The auto industry is in decline but has not yet collapsed. Motown has moved to LA. There is a feeling of living in the last days of something -- the parties are louder because people sense the silence coming."]
- **Cultural Context:** [Social norms, political climate. Example: "Post-civil-rights, pre-Reagan. Black middle class is growing but fragile. The police are a constant, hostile presence."]
- **Sensory Reality of the Era:** [What the era looked, sounded, felt like. Example: "The cars are enormous and chrome-heavy. The music is everywhere -- Stevie Wonder from passing cars, Parliament from the basement parties. Wide lapels, platform shoes, afros."]
- **What Must Be Historically Accurate:** [Example: "Dates of major events. Song releases. Car models. Neighborhood geography."]
- **What Can Be Impressionistic:** [Example: "Exact dialogue from 40 years ago. The order of minor events. Weather on specific days."]
- **Period Details That Ground the Narrative:** [Concrete sensory details. Example: "The taste of Faygo pop. The smell of Jheri curl activator. The weight of a rotary phone receiver. The feel of shag carpet."]

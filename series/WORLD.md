## Systems

<!-- Magic systems, technology, organizations -- anything with internal rules that the narrative must respect. -->

### [System Name, e.g., Magic System / Technology Framework / Organization]

- **Core Mechanic:** [How it works at the most basic level]
- **Costs / Limits:** [What using it costs, what it cannot do]
- **Who Has Access:** [Who can use it, who cannot]
- **Rules:**
  1. [Rule 1 -- e.g., "Cannot be used to bring back the dead"]
  2. [Rule 2 -- e.g., "Requires line of sight"]
  3. [Rule 3]
- **Established In:** [Book and chapter where these rules are locked]

<!-- Duplicate this template for each major system. -->
<!-- Systems are contracts: once the reader knows a rule, you must follow it or explain the exception. -->

| Constraint | Reason | Established In |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| [e.g., "Time travel is impossible"] | [Preserves causal storytelling] | book-01, CH-01 |

| [e.g., "The organization cannot operate outside the Capital"] | [Political constraint driving book-02 plot] | book-02, CH-01 |

<!-- Constraints prevent accidental deus ex machina and preserve internal logic. -->
<!-- Removing a constraint requires an EDR. -->

# Series Arc

<!-- reviewed: 2026-02-13 -->

> This file defines the macro plot/argument structure that spans all books in the series.
> Individual book outlines must align with the arc defined here.
> Changes to the series arc require an EDR and updates to all affected per-book outlines.

## Series-Level Arc

<!-- The overarching narrative, argument, or thematic journey that connects all books into a single whole. One to three paragraphs. -->

[Replace with a description of the series-level arc. This is NOT a summary of each book -- it is the single throughline that makes the series a series rather than a collection. Example: "Across three books, the series traces the fall and rebuilding of X, arguing that Y. Book 1 establishes the status quo and shatters it. Book 2 explores the consequences. Book 3 forges a new equilibrium."]

## Per-Book Arc Summary

| Book | Arc Role | Opens With | Closes With | Cliffhanger / Bridge |
|------|----------|------------|-------------|----------------------|
| book-01 | [e.g., Setup / Foundation] | [Opening state or inciting incident] | [Closing state or turning point] | [What carries the reader to book 2?] |
| book-02 | [e.g., Complication / Deepening] | [Opening state] | [Closing state] | [Bridge to book 3] |
| book-03 | [e.g., Resolution / Synthesis] | [Opening state] | [Final resolution] | [Series conclusion -- no bridge needed] |

<!-- Each row summarizes a book's role in the series arc, not its internal structure. -->
<!-- For internal structure, see each book's OUTLINE.md. -->

## Three-Act Structure at Series Level

<!-- Which books constitute Act I, Act II, and Act III of the series? -->
<!-- For a two-book series, use Setup / Resolution. -->
<!-- For series longer than three books, assign acts as appropriate. -->

| Series Act | Books | Purpose |
|------------|-------|---------|
| **Act I -- Setup** | book-01 | [Introduce world, characters, central problem/question] |
| **Act II -- Confrontation** | book-02 | [Escalate stakes, deepen complexity, subvert expectations] |
| **Act III -- Resolution** | book-03 | [Resolve central problem/question, deliver series promise] |

---

## Escalation Pattern

<!-- How do stakes, complexity, or scope increase from book to book? -->

| Transition | Escalation | Details |
|------------|------------|---------|
| book-01 to book-02 | [e.g., Stakes move from personal to communal] | [Specific description of what intensifies] |
| book-02 to book-03 | [e.g., Stakes move from communal to existential] | [Specific description of what intensifies] |

<!-- Escalation can be: stakes, scope, emotional intensity, conceptual complexity, -->
<!-- number of active threads, moral ambiguity, or any other dimension relevant to the series. -->

---

## Series Climax

<!-- The single moment (or sequence) where the series-level arc reaches its peak. -->

- **Book:** [Which book contains the series climax?]
- **Approximate Location:** [Beginning / Middle / End of that book]
- **Description:** [One to two sentences describing the climactic moment]
- **Why This Moment:** [What makes this the peak of the entire series, not just one book?]

---

## Resolution

<!-- How does the series conclude? What state does the world / argument / character reach? -->

- **Final State:** [One to two sentences: what the world/argument/character looks like at series end]
- **Open vs. Closed:** [Is the ending definitive, or does it leave room for continuation?]
- **Series Promise Delivered:** [How does the ending fulfill the promise made in SERIES_OVERVIEW.md?]

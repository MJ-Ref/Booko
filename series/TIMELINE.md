# Series Timeline

<!-- reviewed: 2026-02-13 -->

> Master chronological timeline spanning all books in the series.
> This is the single source of truth for WHEN events happen.
> Per-book CONTINUITY_BIBLE.md files track per-book timelines; this file tracks the series-wide view.

## Timeline Overview

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Total Time Span** | [e.g., "3 years", "one summer", "1965-1990"] |
| **Calendar System** | [e.g., "Gregorian calendar", "In-world calendar with 10 months", "Seasons only -- no exact dates"] |
| **Temporal Structure** | [e.g., "Linear", "Nonlinear with flashbacks", "Parallel timelines converging in book-03"] |
| **Time Between Books** | [e.g., "6 months between book-01 and book-02", "Immediate continuation"] |

## Master Timeline

<!-- Chronological order by in-world date. Use story-world dates, not publication order. -->

| Date / Time | Event | Book | Chapter | Significance |
|------------|-------|------|---------|--------------|
| [e.g., Year 1, Spring] | [Inciting incident] | book-01 | CH-01 | [Launches series arc] |
| [e.g., Year 1, Summer] | [Key event] | book-01 | CH-05 | [Escalation point] |
| [e.g., Year 1, Autumn] | [Book-01 climax] | book-01 | CH-12 | [End of Act I at series level] |
| [e.g., Year 2, Winter] | [Book-02 opening] | book-02 | CH-01 | [6-month gap from book-01] |
| [e.g., Year 2, Spring] | [Midpoint event] | book-02 | CH-08 | [Series midpoint] |
| [e.g., Year 2, Summer] | [Book-02 climax] | book-02 | CH-15 | [End of Act II at series level] |
| [e.g., Year 3, Spring] | [Series climax] | book-03 | CH-10 | [Peak of series arc] |
| [e.g., Year 3, Summer] | [Resolution] | book-03 | CH-14 | [Series conclusion] |

<!-- For nonlinear narratives, add a "Reader Encounters" column to distinguish -->
<!-- story-world chronology from narrative presentation order. -->

---

## Pre-Series Events

<!-- Backstory events that are referenced in the series but occur before book-01 opens. -->

| Date / Era | Event | First Referenced In | Significance |
|-----------|-------|---------------------|--------------|
| [e.g., 20 years before] | [Event that shaped the protagonist] | book-01, CH-02 | [Motivation for protagonist's goal] |
| [e.g., 100 years before] | [Historical event] | book-01, CH-06 | [Explains current political situation] |
| [e.g., 5 years before] | [Triggering event] | book-01, CH-01 | [Direct cause of inciting incident] |

<!-- Only include backstory that is REFERENCED in the text. -->
<!-- Unreferenced history belongs in author notes, not here. -->

---

## Inter-Book Gaps

<!-- What happens between books? Even if the gap is short, document it. -->

| Gap | Duration | Key Events During Gap | Source |
|-----|----------|-----------------------|--------|
| book-01 to book-02 | [e.g., 6 months] | [What changes during the gap? Character movements, world events, off-page developments] | [handoffs/BOOK-01-TO-02.md](handoffs/BOOK-01-TO-02.md) |
| book-02 to book-03 | [e.g., 1 year] | [Gap events] | [handoffs/BOOK-02-TO-03.md](handoffs/BOOK-02-TO-03.md) |

<!-- Inter-book gaps are a common source of continuity errors. -->
<!-- If a gap is "immediate continuation" (no time passes), state that explicitly. -->

---

## Parallel Timelines

<!-- If POV characters are in different places or times simultaneously. -->
<!-- Skip this section if the narrative has a single linear timeline. -->

| Timeline | Characters | Time Span | Converges In | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-----------|-------------|-------|
| [Timeline A] | [Character A, Character C] | [book-01 CH-01 through book-02 CH-05] | [book-02, CH-10] | [Main narrative thread] |
| [Timeline B] | [Character B] | [book-01 CH-03 through book-02 CH-05] | [book-02, CH-10] | [Secondary thread; runs 2 weeks behind Timeline A] |

<!-- Parallel timelines require extra care. Mark convergence points clearly. -->
<!-- Readers will notice if parallel characters experience inconsistent weather, -->
<!-- news events, or seasonal changes. -->

---

## Timeline Consistency Rules

1. **All events must have a relative or absolute date.** Vague timing ("sometime later") is acceptable in the text but must be pinned down here.
2. **Character ages must be consistent.** If Character A is 30 in book-01 and 3 years pass, they are 33 in book-03. Track this in [CHARACTERS.md](CHARACTERS.md).
3. **Seasonal and environmental details must match the timeline.** If it is winter in the timeline, it cannot be warm and sunny unless the setting is in a warm climate.
4. **Travel time must be plausible.** If a journey takes 3 days in book-01, it cannot take 1 day in book-02 without explanation.
5. **Day/night cycles must be consistent.** If a scene begins at sunset and continues "for hours," it should be dark.
6. **Inter-book gaps must be documented.** No undocumented time jumps between books.

<!-- Timeline violations are among the most commonly caught continuity errors. -->
<!-- When in doubt, add it to the timeline and check for conflicts. -->

## Cast Overview

<!-- Quick-reference table for the full cast. Keep this ruthlessly up to date.
     One row per named character. The "One-Line Arc" column should capture the
     ENTIRE series transformation in a single sentence — if you can't do that,
     you don't yet understand the character well enough. -->

| Name | Role | Introduced In | One-Line Arc | Series-End Status |
|------|------|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| [Elena Vasquez] | [Protagonist] | book-01, CH-01 | [A woman who trusts no one learns that vulnerability is not the same as weakness] | [Alive — changed] |
| [Marcus Hale] | [Antagonist / later ally] | book-01, CH-03 | [A righteous man discovers his certainty has been cruelty in disguise] | [Alive — diminished] |
| [Sable Orin] | [Supporting — confidant] | book-01, CH-02 | [The person who holds everyone together finally asks to be held] | [Deceased — book-03, CH-18] |
| [Jonah Crewe] | [Supporting — catalyst] | book-02, CH-01 | [An outsider's arrival forces the cast to see their world through unfamiliar eyes] | [Departed — left the city after book-03] |

## Full Character Profile

<!-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
     TEMPLATE: Copy everything between the ═══ lines for each major character.
     Minor characters do not need this full treatment — a row in the Cast
     Overview and a note in Consistency Rules is enough for walk-on parts.

     The depth here is intentional. A character is not a collection of traits;
     they are a living system of contradictions, habits, wounds, and longings.
     The more precisely you define them HERE, the more naturally they will
     behave on the page, and the less continuity work you will need later.

### [Elena Vasquez]

<!-- Repeat this entire section structure for each major character. -->

#### Identity

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Full Legal Name** | [Elena Maria Vasquez] |
| **Aliases / Nicknames** | [Lena (only Sable uses this); "the Architect" (professional reputation); never "Ellie" — she corrects anyone who tries] |
| **Age at Each Book Start** | [book-01: 34; book-02: 35; book-03: 37 (two-year gap between books 2 and 3)] |
| **Birthday** | [March 3 — she does not celebrate it; the reason is revealed in book-02, CH-09] |
| **Birthplace** | [San Clemente, California — left at 17, has not returned] |
| **Current Residence (per book)** | [book-01: rented flat above the print shop on Garner St; book-02: same; book-03: Marcus's old house, reluctantly] |
| **Occupation / Role** | [Structural architect by training; acting director of the Reclamation Office by book-01, CH-04] |

#### Physical Presence

<!-- Do not just list hair color and height. Describe how this person EXISTS in space.
     A character's physicality is how the reader experiences them before a single word
     of dialogue. Think about what a stranger would notice from across the room,
     and then what a lover would notice up close. -->

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Build and Stature** | [5'7", lean, narrow-shouldered — looks lighter than she is; deceptively strong grip] |
| **Coloring** | [Dark brown hair with early gray at the left temple (appears book-02); warm brown skin that goes sallow when she's exhausted; dark eyes that people describe as "sharp"] |
| **What People Notice First** | [Her stillness. She doesn't fidget. In a room full of movement, she's the fixed point] |
| **What People Notice Second** | [Her hands — she has a drafter's hands, long-fingered and precise, and she talks with them when she's passionate about something] |
| **Posture and Carriage** | [Stands very straight, weight evenly distributed — trained herself out of a teenage slouch. When stressed, she folds her arms, one hand gripping the opposite elbow] |
| **Gait** | [Walks fast, purpose in every step. Doesn't stroll. Slows down only when she's thinking hard, and then she stops entirely] |
| **Physical Habits / Tells** | [Presses her thumbnail into the pad of her index finger when anxious (she doesn't know she does this). Tilts her head left when she's about to disagree. Rubs the back of her neck when caught in a lie] |
| **How Their Body Changes Across the Series** | [book-01: controlled, precise, almost rigid. book-02: loses weight during the siege, visible fatigue. book-03: a long scar across her left forearm from the collapse in book-02 CH-22; she carries herself differently — less rigid, more weary, but somehow more present] |

#### Psychology

<!-- This is the engine of the character. Everything they do in the story flows
     from these elements. The CORE WOUND is the most important thing here — it is
     the original injury (often from childhood) that shaped their false belief about
     the world, which in turn drives their want, their fear, and their defense
     mechanisms. The character's ARC is the process of confronting this wound. -->

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Core Wound** | [Her father's sudden abandonment when she was 12. He left without explanation and she later learned he had a second family. The wound is not the leaving — it's the discovery that someone can perform love flawlessly while it means nothing] |
| **False Belief** | [That intimacy is performance. That everyone is performing. That the only safety is in never depending on anyone's interior life, only their observable actions] |
| **Want (conscious)** | [To build something that lasts — literally (architecture) and figuratively (the Reclamation Office). She wants proof that permanence exists] |
| **Need (unconscious)** | [To let someone see her unfinished, imperfect, mid-process — and not leave. She needs to be known, not just relied upon] |
| **Deepest Fear** | [Being fooled again. Loving someone who is pretending. She would rather be alone than be deceived] |
| **Shame** | [She checked. After her father left, she spent months replaying every memory, looking for the lie. She is ashamed of how long she believed him, and ashamed that she still sometimes misses him] |
| **Defense Mechanisms** | [Hyper-competence (if she's indispensable, people need her — which is safer than being wanted). Emotional distance framed as professionalism. Testing people with small betrayals to see if they'll leave] |
| **Attachment Style** | [Dismissive-avoidant, trending toward earned security by book-03 — but it costs her] |

#### Voice and Speech

<!-- A character's voice is not just WHAT they say but HOW they say it. Two characters
     can deliver the same information and sound completely different. If you can swap
     one character's dialogue into another character's mouth without anyone noticing,
     the voices are not distinct enough. Fill this section with enough detail that an
     agent can generate dialogue that is unmistakably this person. -->

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Vocabulary Level** | [High — she's educated and precise. Uses technical language naturally, not to impress. Will say "load-bearing" metaphorically without noticing she's being an architect about everything] |
| **Sentence Length** | [Short and declarative when she's in control. Longer, recursive, almost run-on when she's losing control emotionally — the grammar fractures before she does] |
| **Verbal Tics / Pet Phrases** | ["The thing is" (stalling phrase — means she's about to say something difficult). "That's not nothing" (highest compliment). Never says "I love you" directly until book-03, CH-24] |
| **Cursing Habits** | [Rarely, and in Spanish when she does — which signals real distress because she otherwise avoids her mother's language] |
| **When Angry** | [Gets quieter and more precise. Her sentences shorten. She asks devastating questions instead of making accusations: "And you thought that was acceptable?"] |
| **When Calm** | [Warm, slightly dry humor. Uses architectural metaphors. Listens more than she talks. Comfortable with silence] |
| **When Afraid** | [Becomes very practical — fear activates her planning brain. She'll start organizing, listing, strategizing. The fear leaks through as over-preparation] |
| **When Lying** | [She's good at it. Too good. The only tell is that she becomes slightly more articulate than the situation warrants — rehearsed] |
| **Topics That Make Her Eloquent** | [Buildings, structures, how things bear weight. The ethics of public spaces. She comes alive when describing how a structure works] |
| **Topics That Make Her Inarticulate** | [Her father. Her childhood. Anything that requires her to describe her own emotions in real time — she can analyze them after the fact but not during] |
| **Speech Evolution Across Series** | [book-01: controlled, professional, revealing nothing. book-02: begins to crack — there are moments of raw honesty that surprise even her. book-03: still precise, but warmer; she's learned to say difficult things without armoring them in professionalism first] |

#### Behavioral Patterns

<!-- Characters are revealed not by what they say about themselves but by what they
     DO, especially in small moments. How someone treats a waiter, handles money,
     or enters a room tells the reader more than any internal monologue. -->

| Behavior | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| **Decision-Making Under Pressure** | [Goes still. Gathers information. Acts decisively once she has enough — but her threshold for "enough" is lower than most people's, which makes her look impulsive to cautious people and reckless to cowards] |
| **Conflict Response** | [Fight — but she fights with precision, not volume. She will dismantle an argument before the other person realizes they're in a debate. Escalates only when cornered] |
| **How They Enter a Room** | [Assesses the space before entering. Chooses a position with sightlines to the door — this is unconscious, not tactical. Doesn't announce herself] |
| **How They Eat** | [Eats quickly, efficiently, often while working. Doesn't cook. Food is fuel, not pleasure — until Sable teaches her to slow down in book-02, and then she grieves through food in book-03] |
| **How They Handle Money** | [Generous with others, austere with herself. Her flat is sparse. She'll fund someone else's project without hesitation but agonizes over buying herself a new coat] |
| **How They Treat People With Less Power** | [Respectfully, but she can be oblivious to the power she holds. She treats the intern like a colleague, which is both flattering and overwhelming] |
| **How They Treat People With More Power** | [Exactly the same as everyone else. This is both her greatest strength and why she makes enemies] |
| **Habits and Rituals** | [Walks the perimeter of any new building she enters. Drafts by hand before using any tool. Keeps a pocket notebook — not for sentiment, for precision] |

#### Relationship Patterns

<!-- How a character forms and maintains bonds is as defining as their psychology.
     This section should explain not just WHO they connect with but HOW and WHY —
     and what breaks the connection. -->

| Pattern | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **How They Form Attachments** | [Slowly, through demonstrated reliability. She does not befriend — she observes, tests, and eventually admits someone to her trust. The process can take years] |
| **What They Look for in Friends** | [Consistency. She can forgive cruelty more easily than inconsistency. She needs to predict you before she can trust you] |
| **How They Handle Betrayal** | [Complete severance. She does not rage, does not plead. She simply reclassifies the person as a stranger and behaves accordingly. This terrifies people who love her] |
| **Loyalty Patterns** | [Once you're in, you're in. She'll sacrifice for the people she trusts in ways that border on self-destruction. But she will not explain why, which makes her sacrifices feel more like control than love] |
| **Who They Trust Easily** | [People who are visibly imperfect. People who don't perform competence. She's disarmed by vulnerability in others because she can't fake it herself] |
| **Who They Don't Trust** | [Charming people. People who agree with her too readily. People who remind her of her father — especially those who are warm and generous in public] |
| **How Their Trust Is Earned** | [Be honest about a small, unflattering thing. Don't perform. Show up again after a conflict instead of disappearing. Time is the primary ingredient] |

#### Knowledge State

<!-- Track what each character knows across books. This prevents the agonizing error
     where a character acts on information they shouldn't have, or fails to act on
     information they should. Coordinate with the Character Knowledge Matrix below. -->

| Book | What They Know That Others Don't | What Others Know That They Don't | What the Reader Knows That They Don't |
|------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| book-01 | [She knows the original blueprints were falsified — she found the discrepancy in CH-04 and told no one] | [Marcus knows her father's identity and has known since before they met] | [The reader sees Marcus's recognition in CH-03, but Elena won't learn this until book-02, CH-15] |
| book-02 | [She has deduced the identity of the saboteur by CH-08 but withholds it to protect Sable] | [Sable's illness — everyone knows except Elena, who is being shielded] | [The reader knows Sable is dying from CH-02; Elena doesn't learn until CH-19] |
| book-03 | [She knows Marcus has changed but is afraid to believe it — she is the last to acknowledge his transformation] | [Jonah's real reason for arriving — he was sent, not wandering] | [The reader sees Elena's father watching the Reclamation Office from across the street in the epilogue; she does not] |

#### Secrets

<!-- Secrets are narrative engines. A secret creates tension the moment it exists and
     releases energy the moment it's revealed. Track each secret's lifecycle:
     who holds it, who it's hidden from, and when/how it detonates. -->

| Secret | Hidden From | Reveal Point | Consequences |
|--------|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| [She sabotaged her father's last project before he left — a childish act of revenge that she's never told anyone about] | [Everyone] | [book-02, CH-20 — she confesses to Marcus during the siege, believing they'll both die] | [Marcus recognizes the parallel to his own certainty-as-cruelty. It becomes the basis of their reluctant alliance in book-03] |
| [She's been sending money to her father's second family — not out of forgiveness, but out of a need to be different from him] | [Sable suspects but never asks directly] | [book-03, CH-09 — Jonah discovers the transfers and confronts her] | [Forces her to articulate WHY, which she has never done. The scene is the hinge of her book-03 arc] |

#### Backstory

<!-- Backstory is not biography. It is the specific collection of experiences that
     explain why this person does what they do NOW. Not every detail will appear in
     the text, but the author must know them all. Track what has been revealed vs.
     what is held in reserve vs. what will never appear on the page. -->

| Element | Detail | Revealed In | Status |
|---------|--------|-------------|--------|
| [Father's abandonment — age 12, no warning, found out about the second family from a neighbor] | [This is the foundational event. Everything about her trust patterns traces back to this morning] | [Partial in book-01, CH-11 (she alludes to it); full detail in book-02, CH-09] | [Fully revealed by mid-series] |
| [Mother's response — not grief but relief, which Elena experienced as a second betrayal] | [Her mother said "Now we can breathe." Elena realized her mother had been performing unhappiness for years] | [book-02, CH-14, in a conversation with Sable] | [Revealed] |
| [A college mentor who believed in her, then died before her first building was completed] | [This is why she finishes things. Completion is a form of loyalty to him] | [Never revealed directly — it lives in her behavior, not her dialogue] | [Author-only knowledge] |
| [She was briefly married in her twenties — annulled after four months] | [She realized she had married someone safe and felt nothing. The absence of feeling frightened her more than pain would have] | [book-03, CH-05 — Jonah finds the record] | [Held until book-03] |

#### Character Arc

<!-- The arc is the transformation. Map it across the full series with enough
     specificity that any agent writing a scene can check: "Where is this character
     in their arc right now? What do they believe at this point? What are they
     resisting?" -->

| Stage | Book / Chapter | Detail |
|-------|---------------|--------|
| **Start State** | book-01, CH-01 | [Competent, controlled, emotionally sealed. She believes she has solved the problem of human connection by not needing it] |
| **Catalyst** | book-01, CH-04 | [The falsified blueprints force her into collaboration. She cannot solve this alone, which is intolerable to her] |
| **Resistance** | book-01, CH-06–15 | [She collaborates but refuses to trust. She treats allies as tools. It works — until it doesn't] |
| **Midpoint Shift** | book-01, CH-18 | [Sable calls her out: "You don't have colleagues, Elena. You have hostages." She can't dismiss this because Sable is the one person she can't control] |
| **Deepening** | book-02, CH-01–08 | [The siege forces proximity. She cannot maintain distance while sharing a building with people for weeks. She begins to crack, and the cracking terrifies her] |
| **Crisis** | book-02, CH-19–22 | [Sable's illness revealed. The collapse. Her confession to Marcus. Everything she built — literal and figurative — comes down at once] |
| **Transformation** | book-03, CH-12–18 | [She rebuilds. Not the building — herself. She asks for help. She says "I don't know." She lets Marcus see her unfinished, mid-process, uncertain] |
| **End State** | book-03, CH-24 | [Not healed — changed. She still flinches at charm. She still tests people. But she can say "I need you" and mean it, and she can survive the vulnerability of being known] |

#### Contradictions

<!-- Real people are not consistent. They contain multitudes, hypocrisies, and blind spots.
     A character without contradictions is a thesis statement, not a person. Define the
     intentional contradictions that make this character human — and make sure they are
     INTENTIONAL, not continuity errors. -->

- [She values honesty above all else — but she is an expert liar who lies to protect people, which she does not recognize as a contradiction]
- [She craves permanence and builds structures meant to last centuries — but she has never stayed in one home for more than three years]
- [She is generous with money and stingy with emotion — and she genuinely does not understand why people find this insufficient]
- [She can read other people with devastating accuracy — but she is nearly illiterate about her own emotional state in real time]

## Character Arc Tracking

<!-- Per-book state tracking with emotional granularity. The Cast Overview tells you
     WHERE a character ends up. This section tells you HOW THEY FEEL getting there.
     Without emotional tracking, characters transform in the outline but not on the page. -->

### [Elena Vasquez]

| Book | Emotional Temperature at Start | What They Want at Start | Key Turning Points (with chapter refs) | What Breaks or Changes Them | Emotional Temperature at End | What They Want at End |
|------|-------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------|
| book-01 | [Cold. Controlled. Professionally confident, personally numb] | [To complete the Reclamation Office project and prove it can be done by one person's vision] | [CH-04: discovers falsified blueprints. CH-11: first personal conversation with Sable. CH-18: Sable's confrontation] | [The realization that her self-sufficiency is not strength but avoidance — and the worse realization that she already knew this] | [Unsettled. The ice has cracked but hasn't broken] | [Still wants the project — but is beginning to suspect she also wants something she can't blueprint] |
| book-02 | [Wary. The cracks from book-01 have made her hypervigilant — she's trying to re-seal what opened] | [To maintain control of the project during the siege. To NOT need anyone] | [CH-05: first genuine laughter. CH-15: learns Marcus knew her father. CH-19: Sable's illness. CH-22: the collapse] | [Loss. Sable's dying, the building falls, and her confession to Marcus strips away her last armor] | [Raw. Exposed. Exhausted. But, for the first time, not performing composure] | [She doesn't know what she wants. That's the breakthrough — she has never before admitted to not knowing] |
| book-03 | [Grief-hollowed. Quiet in a new way — less controlled silence, more emptied-out silence] | [To rebuild the building. The building is a proxy for everything she can't say] | [CH-05: the annulment discovery. CH-09: the money transfers revealed. CH-12: she asks Marcus for help — the first time she has asked anyone] | [Sable's death (CH-18). But also: Marcus showing up consistently, without performance, for months. The slow, undramic evidence that someone can be real] | [Warm. Scarred. Open in a way that is clearly effortful but genuine] | [To be known. To let the building be finished by many hands, not just hers] |

<!-- Copy this per-book tracking block for each major character. -->

### [Marcus Hale]

| Book | Emotional Temperature at Start | What They Want at Start | Key Turning Points (with chapter refs) | What Breaks or Changes Them | Emotional Temperature at End | What They Want at End |
|------|-------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------|
| book-01 | [Righteous. Hot. Certain he is the moral center of every room he enters] | [To stop the Reclamation project, which he believes is corrupt] | [CH-03: arrival and confrontation. CH-10: first private doubt. CH-18: overhears Sable's confrontation of Elena and recognizes himself in the description] | [The slow, humiliating discovery that his certainty has been serving his ego, not his principles] | [Shaken. Still oppositional, but the foundation has shifted] | [To be right — but he's no longer sure what "right" means] |
| book-02 | [Chastened but not yet transformed. Performing humility without fully feeling it] | [To make amends — but on his terms, which is still a form of control] | [CH-08: Elena deduces the saboteur and he realizes she's protecting Sable, not herself. CH-20: Elena's confession during the siege] | [Elena's honesty under pressure. She shows him what vulnerability without performance looks like] | [Genuinely humbled. The performance of humility has been replaced by the real thing, which is quieter and less comfortable] | [To be useful without needing to be important] |
| book-03 | [Quiet. Steady. Doing the unglamorous daily work of being trustworthy] | [To earn Elena's trust — not because he deserves it, but because she deserves someone trying] | [CH-12: Elena asks him for help. CH-18: Sable's death and its aftermath. CH-22: he tells Elena the truth about knowing her father — unprompted, expecting to lose her] | [The discovery that integrity is not a grand gesture but a daily practice, and that he has been confusing the two his entire life] | [Settled. Diminished in stature but enlarged in character] | [Nothing dramatic. To show up again tomorrow. And the day after] |

## Character Voice Matrix

<!-- This table is critical for agents generating dialogue. If two characters
     sound the same on the page, the reader cannot hear them. Use this matrix
     to ensure every major character's speech is distinctly their own.
     Read it COLUMN by column to compare characters against each other. -->

| Character | Vocabulary Level | Sentence Length | Verbal Tics | Articulate About | Avoids Talking About | Expresses Anger By | Expresses Affection By | How They Lie |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------|-----------------|---------------------|-------------------|----------------------|-------------|
| [Elena Vasquez] | [High — precise, technical, architectural metaphors] | [Short when composed; long and fragmenting when emotional] | ["The thing is." Thumbnail pressed to index finger] | [Structures, systems, ethics of space] | [Her father, her feelings in real time] | [Getting quieter. Asking devastating questions] | [Acts of service — fixing, building, funding. Never words until book-03] | [Becomes more articulate than the moment warrants — polished, rehearsed] |
| [Marcus Hale] | [High — rhetorical, sermonic, prone to aphorisms] | [Long, oratorical — he speaks in paragraphs. Shortens only when genuinely uncertain] | ["Let me be clear." Adjusts his cuffs when preparing a speech] | [Justice, history, moral philosophy] | [His childhood. His ex-wife. Anything that makes him the subject instead of the authority] | [Volume, then shame. He raises his voice, then hates himself for it] | [Grand gestures that are more about his narrative than the other person's needs — until book-03, when he learns to be small and steady] | [Omission. He does not fabricate — he selects which truths to share. Harder to catch] |
| [Sable Orin] | [Middle — warm, colloquial, peppered with region-specific idiom] | [Medium, conversational. Matches whoever they're talking to — a verbal chameleon] | ["Here's the thing about that." Hums when thinking] | [People. Reads a room the way Elena reads a blueprint] | [Their illness. Their fear of being forgotten] | [Disappointment, not fury. "I expected more from you" hits harder than any shout] | [Naming what others feel before they can. Making someone feel seen] | [Misdirection — they answer a different question than the one asked, so warmly that you don't notice] |
| [Jonah Crewe] | [Low-to-middle — plainspoken, concrete, no abstractions] | [Short. Declarative. Subject-verb-object. Distrusts complexity in language] | ["Fair enough." Long pauses before speaking — he considers words expensive] | [Practical things: weather, mechanics, distances, directions] | [Why he's really here. His employers. His past] | [Silence. Walks away. If pushed past his threshold, physical — a slammed door, never a person] | [Presence. He sits near people he cares about. He remembers what they said weeks ago] | [Doesn't. He withholds, but he won't fabricate. If pressed, he'll say "I can't tell you that" rather than invent] |

## Character Knowledge Matrix

<!-- WHO KNOWS WHAT, AND WHEN.
     This is the single most important continuity tool for a series. Dramatic irony
     depends on the reader knowing what characters don't. Continuity errors happen
     when a character acts on information they shouldn't have, or inexplicably fails
     to act on information they should.

     Rows are secrets or key pieces of knowledge. Columns are characters.
     Mark each cell: KNOWS (book, ch), DOESN'T KNOW, SUSPECTS, LEARNS (book, ch).
     Update this matrix every time information transfers between characters. -->

### Book 01

| Knowledge / Secret | Elena | Marcus | Sable | Jonah |
|--------------------|-------|--------|-------|-------|
| [The blueprints were falsified] | KNOWS (CH-04) | DOESN'T KNOW | DOESN'T KNOW | [Not yet introduced] |
| [Marcus's connection to Elena's father] | DOESN'T KNOW | KNOWS (pre-series) | SUSPECTS (CH-08) | [Not yet introduced] |
| [Elena's father had a second family] | KNOWS (pre-series) | KNOWS (pre-series) | KNOWS (CH-11, Elena tells her) | [Not yet introduced] |
| [The identity of the saboteur] | SUSPECTS (CH-14) | DOESN'T KNOW | DOESN'T KNOW | [Not yet introduced] |

### Book 02

| Knowledge / Secret | Elena | Marcus | Sable | Jonah |
|--------------------|-------|--------|-------|-------|
| [The blueprints were falsified] | KNOWS | LEARNS (CH-03) | LEARNS (CH-03) | DOESN'T KNOW |
| [Marcus's connection to Elena's father] | LEARNS (CH-15) | KNOWS | KNOWS (confirmed CH-10) | DOESN'T KNOW |
| [The identity of the saboteur] | KNOWS (CH-08) | DOESN'T KNOW | SUSPECTS (CH-12) | DOESN'T KNOW |
| [Sable's terminal illness] | DOESN'T KNOW (shielded) | KNOWS (CH-06) | KNOWS (pre-book) | KNOWS (CH-04) |
| [Elena's childhood sabotage of her father's project] | KNOWS (reveals CH-20) | LEARNS (CH-20) | DOESN'T KNOW | DOESN'T KNOW |

<!-- Continue this pattern for each book. The matrix grows as secrets accumulate. -->

## Relationship Web

<!-- Every significant relationship has an architecture: who has power, what each
     person wants from the other, what each person fears. Relationships are not
     static labels ("friends," "rivals") — they are living negotiations that
     shift across the series. Track the shifts. -->

### [Elena] and [Marcus]

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Emotional Valence** | [Hostile (book-01) → grudging respect (book-02) → trust built on shared brokenness (book-03)] |
| **Power Dynamic** | [book-01: Marcus holds institutional power, Elena holds competence-power. book-02: equalized by crisis. book-03: Elena holds emotional power because Marcus has changed more than she has, and they both know it] |
| **What Elena Wants From Marcus** | [book-01: to be left alone. book-02: to understand why he knew about her father. book-03: to believe he's real] |
| **What Marcus Wants From Elena** | [book-01: her compliance, framed as "the right thing." book-02: her forgiveness, framed as justice. book-03: nothing he can name — which is the first honest thing he's wanted] |
| **What Elena Fears About Marcus** | [That he's another performer. That his transformation is a longer con. That she'll trust him and be wrong again] |
| **What Marcus Fears About Elena** | [That she sees through him. That she always has. That she's right to] |
| **Key Defining Scenes** | [book-01, CH-03: first confrontation. book-01, CH-18: Elena overhears him falter privately. book-02, CH-15: the father revelation. book-02, CH-20: the confession during the siege. book-03, CH-12: she asks for help. book-03, CH-22: he tells the truth about her father unprompted] |

### [Elena] and [Sable]

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Emotional Valence** | [The most important relationship in the series. Love without performance. The one bond Elena trusts completely] |
| **Power Dynamic** | [Sable holds emotional authority — they're the only person who can tell Elena hard truths and be heard. Elena holds practical power — resources, protection, problem-solving. It balances] |
| **What Elena Wants From Sable** | [To be seen. Sable is the only person who sees Elena accurately and stays] |
| **What Sable Wants From Elena** | [To be needed. And, in book-02, permission to be fragile — which Elena cannot give because she doesn't know about the illness] |
| **What Elena Fears About Sable** | [Nothing — which is itself the vulnerability. She has no defenses here] |
| **What Sable Fears About Elena** | [That Elena will collapse without them. That they've made Elena dependent on the one person who is about to leave] |
| **Key Defining Scenes** | [book-01, CH-02: first meeting. book-01, CH-11: first real conversation. book-01, CH-18: "You don't have colleagues, you have hostages." book-02, CH-19: Elena discovers the illness. book-03, CH-18: Sable's death. book-03, CH-24: Elena speaks to Sable's absence as if they can hear] |

## Character Foils and Mirrors

<!-- Characters illuminate each other through contrast and parallel. A foil shows what
     the protagonist is NOT; a mirror shows what they COULD BE. The juxtaposition
     makes both characters more legible and serves the series' thematic argument.
     Define these pairings deliberately — they should feel discovered by the reader,
     not announced by the author. -->

| Pairing | Type | Thematic Question | How It Works |
|---------|------|-------------------|-------------|
| [Elena / Marcus] | [Foil] | [Is certainty a form of care, or a form of violence?] | [Both are rigid. Elena's rigidity is defensive (protect the self); Marcus's is offensive (correct the world). Their convergence in book-03 asks whether rigidity can soften without collapsing] |
| [Elena / Sable] | [Mirror] | [What does strength look like when it isn't armored?] | [Sable is everything Elena could be if she let herself be known. Sable's death is devastating because it removes the living proof that openness is survivable] |
| [Marcus / Jonah] | [Foil] | [What is the relationship between eloquence and honesty?] | [Marcus speaks beautifully and uses language to control. Jonah speaks plainly and uses silence to protect. The reader learns to trust Jonah's pauses more than Marcus's paragraphs] |
| [Elena / Jonah] | [Mirror] | [Can two people who hide in different ways recognize each other?] | [Elena hides behind competence, Jonah behind simplicity. They share the experience of being underestimated by the parts they show — and overestimated by the parts they conceal] |

## Consistency Rules

<!-- Once a detail is stated in published or final text, it becomes a contract with the
     reader. Violating it without narrative justification is an error. This table is
     the enforcement mechanism.

     "Why It Matters" is not optional — if you can't explain why a detail matters,
     it may not need to be locked. But if it DOES matter, the explanation will prevent
     a future collaborator from casually changing it. -->

| Character | Locked Detail | Locked In | Why It Matters | What Would Break If Changed |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|----------------|---------------------------|
| [Elena Vasquez] | [Left-handed. Brown eyes. Scar on left forearm (from book-02, CH-22 forward)] | [Handedness: book-01, CH-01. Eyes: book-01, CH-03. Scar: book-02, CH-22] | [Handedness is referenced in her drafting scenes. The scar is a visible marker of the book-02 collapse — other characters notice it] | [Handedness swap breaks five scenes of specific physical description. Missing scar in book-03 undermines the continuity of consequence] |
| [Elena Vasquez] | [Never shortens her name to "Ellie." Corrects anyone who tries. Only Sable calls her "Lena"] | [book-01, CH-02 (Sable); book-01, CH-06 (corrects a colleague)] | [Name control is a character-defining trait. It reflects her need to dictate the terms of intimacy. Sable's nickname is sacred precisely because it's the only exception] | [Anyone else using "Lena" cheapens the Elena/Sable bond. Elena tolerating "Ellie" contradicts her core characterization] |
| [Marcus Hale] | [Tall. Scar on right hand. Speaks in formal register. Adjusts cuffs when preparing to argue] | [book-01, CH-03] | [The formality is armor, like Elena's precision. The cuff adjustment is a tell that other characters learn to read. It becomes important in book-03, CH-22, when he speaks to Elena WITHOUT adjusting his cuffs — signaling genuine unguarded speech for the first time] | [Changing the tell removes the payoff in book-03. Shifting to casual speech too early undercuts the arc] |
| [Sable Orin] | [Hums when thinking. Uses "here's the thing about that" as an opener. Gray-green eyes] | [book-01, CH-02] | [The humming is how other characters (and the reader) recognize Sable is processing. Elena hears humming in an empty room in book-03, CH-20, and it becomes a grief beat] | [Losing the humming loses the ghost-echo moment in book-03, which is one of the most important beats in the series] |
| [Jonah Crewe] | [Long pauses before speaking. Says "fair enough." Never fabricates — withholds or refuses instead] | [book-02, CH-01] | [His honesty-through-withholding is the counterpoint to Marcus's dishonesty-through-selection. If Jonah lies outright, the thematic architecture of the series collapses] | [A single direct lie from Jonah would require restructuring his entire thematic role] |

## Deceased / Departed Characters

<!-- Characters who die, disappear, or permanently exit the series. This section
     prevents accidental resurrection and, more importantly, tracks the CONSEQUENCES
     of departure. A character's exit should ripple through everyone they touched. -->

| Name | Departed In | Manner | Impact on Remaining Characters | Narrative Consequences | Notes |
|------|------------|--------|-------------------------------|----------------------|-------|
| [Sable Orin] | book-03, CH-18 | [Illness — the death is quiet, not dramatic. They die between scenes, which is the point: Elena doesn't get a final conversation] | [Elena: grief arc through book-03 end, fundamentally reshapes her understanding of loss. Marcus: guilt for the time he wasted opposing them. Jonah: becomes the person who tells Elena the stories about Sable that she missed] | [Sable's absence is felt in every scene after CH-18. The empty space where they would have spoken is a recurring structural choice] | [Foreshadowed by the illness introduced in book-02. The reader has 10+ chapters to prepare; Elena has four] |
| [Character E — placeholder] | [book-02, CH-12] | [Describe the manner of departure] | [Which characters are affected, and how specifically] | [What plot consequences follow from this exit] | [Foreshadowing, setup, or dramatic irony notes] |

## New Character Introduction Schedule

<!-- Which book introduces which characters? Prevents overcrowding and ensures
     each new arrival has narrative space to be established before the plot
     demands they carry weight. -->

| Book | New Characters | Purpose | Introduction Strategy |
|------|---------------|---------|----------------------|
| book-01 | [Elena Vasquez, Marcus Hale, Sable Orin] | [Establish core triangle: protagonist, antagonist, emotional anchor] | [Elena in scene 1 (reader bonds first). Sable in CH-02 (warmth before conflict). Marcus in CH-03 (conflict established early)] |
| book-02 | [Jonah Crewe, Character E] | [Outsider perspective to destabilize established dynamics; expendable character to raise stakes] | [Jonah arrives CH-01 (new lens from the start). Character E introduced CH-03 (enough time to invest before their departure in CH-12)] |
| book-03 | [Character F — minor only] | [No major introductions. The final book is about the existing cast facing consequences] | [Introduced only as needed for specific scenes; never given POV] |

<!-- Rule of thumb: introduce fewer new characters as the series progresses.
     Late-series introductions need strong justification and should not compete
     with established characters for emotional real estate. -->

## By Book Type

<!-- Fill in the section that matches your series type. Delete or collapse the others.
     The character bible above is genre-agnostic. These sections add genre-specific layers. -->

### Fiction — Character Arcs

- **Protagonist's Series-Long Arc:** [Elena Vasquez: sealed-off competence → forced collaboration → cracking → loss → rebuilding with openness. The arc asks whether vulnerability is a form of structural integrity]
- **Antagonist's Series-Long Arc:** [Marcus Hale: righteous opposition → self-doubt → transformation → quiet daily integrity. His arc asks whether moral certainty can survive self-awareness]
- **Ensemble Dynamics:** [The cast begins as isolated individuals forced together by circumstance. By book-02, they are a reluctant community. By book-03, they are a chosen family that includes the dead — Sable's absence shapes the group as much as their presence did]
- **Thematic Unity:** [Every character arc explores the same question from a different angle: what is the difference between performing a virtue and possessing it? Elena performs self-sufficiency. Marcus performs justice. Sable performs ease. Jonah performs simplicity. The series strips the performance from each of them]

### Nonfiction — Recurring Experts / Subjects

| Name | Role | Appears In | Contribution | Voice / Perspective Notes |
|------|------|-----------|--------------|--------------------------|
| [Expert A] | [Primary source — field researcher] | book-01, book-03 | [Provides firsthand data that anchors the argument; their evolution between appearances reflects the field's evolution] | [Speaks precisely, avoids hedging. Direct quotes should sound confident and empirical] |
| [Subject B] | [Case study — lived experience] | book-02 | [Their story illustrates the central thesis through specific, textured detail rather than abstraction] | [Conversational, emotional, concrete. Quotes should feel intimate and unpolished] |

### Memoir — People in the Author's Life Across Time

| Name | Relationship | Appears In | Significance | Ethical Considerations |
|------|-------------|-----------|--------------|----------------------|
| [Person A] | [Mother] | book-01, book-02, book-03 | [Represents the author's evolving understanding of inheritance — what we receive, what we refuse, what we carry unknowingly] | [Living person — verify comfort level with depiction. What can be named vs. what must be implied] |
| [Person B] | [College friend, later estranged] | book-02 | [Represents a specific life phase; their absence in book-03 is the point — some relationships are not failures, they are seasons] | [May not want to be identifiable. Consider composite or anonymization] |

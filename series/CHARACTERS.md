## Character Arc Tracking

<!-- For each major character, track their state at the start and end of each book. -->

### [Character A]

| Book | State at Book Start | Transformation During Book | State at Book End |
|------|--------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|
| book-01 | [Starting state: beliefs, goals, relationships] | [What changes and why] | [Ending state] |
| book-02 | [Carries forward from book-01 end state] | [What changes and why] | [Ending state] |
| book-03 | [Carries forward from book-02 end state] | [What changes and why] | [Final state] |

### [Character B]

| book-02 | [Starting state] | [Transformation] | [Ending state] |
| book-03 | [Starting state] | [Transformation] | [Final state] |

<!-- Copy this template for each major character. -->

---

## Relationship Web

<!-- Major relationships that evolve across books. -->

| Character A | Character B | Relationship Type | Evolution Across Series |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| [Character A] | [Character B] | [e.g., rivals] | [book-01: rivals; book-02: reluctant allies; book-03: friends] |
| [Character A] | [Character C] | [e.g., mentor/mentee] | [book-01: mentor/mentee; book-02: equals; book-03: reversed roles] |
| [Character B] | [Character D] | [e.g., strangers] | [Do not meet until book-02, CH-05; allies through book-03] |

<!-- Only track relationships that CHANGE across books. -->
<!-- Static relationships (e.g., siblings who stay siblings) only need a note, not a row. -->

---

## Character Consistency Rules

<!-- What MUST stay consistent across all books for each character. Violating these requires an EDR. -->

| Character | Must Stay Consistent | Notes |
|-----------|---------------------|-------|
| [Character A] | [Physical: brown eyes, left-handed. Speech: avoids contractions. Values: loyalty above all.] | [Locked in book-01, CH-01] |
| [Character B] | [Physical: tall, scar on right hand. Speech: uses formal register. Values: truth over comfort.] | [Locked in book-01, CH-03] |
| [Character C] | [Physical: gray hair by book-02. Speech: dialect from region X. Values: family.] | [Hair detail locked in book-02, CH-01] |

<!-- Consistency rules are contracts. Once a detail is stated in published/final text, -->
<!-- it cannot change without an EDR and a RETROACTIVE_LOG.md entry. -->

---

## Deceased / Departed Characters

<!-- Characters who die, disappear, or permanently exit the series. -->

| Name | Departed In | Manner | Impact on Other Characters | Notes |
|------|------------|--------|---------------------------|-------|
| [Character E] | book-02, CH-12 | [Died in battle] | [Character A: grief arc in book-03. Character B: guilt arc.] | [Foreshadowed in book-01, CH-08] |

<!-- This section prevents accidentally reintroducing departed characters -->
<!-- and tracks the narrative consequences of their departure. -->

---

## New Character Introduction Schedule

<!-- Which book introduces which characters? Prevents overcrowding and ensures proper setup. -->

| Book | New Characters Introduced | Purpose |
|------|--------------------------|---------|
| book-01 | [Character A, Character B, Character C] | [Establish core cast] |
| book-02 | [Character D, Character E] | [Expand world, introduce new conflict] |
| book-03 | [Character F -- minor] | [Limited new introductions; focus on resolution] |

<!-- Rule of thumb: introduce fewer new characters as the series progresses. -->
<!-- Late-series introductions need strong justification. -->

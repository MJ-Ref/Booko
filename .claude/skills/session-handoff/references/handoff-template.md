## Book-Specific Fields

### Narrative Temperature
_What is the emotional/tonal state of the writing at session end? Examples: tense and building, reflective and slow, climactic, expository, transitional. This helps the next agent enter the right register._

_(Write "N/A" if no prose was written this session.)_

### Last Written Passage
_Copy the final 200-300 words of prose written this session. This gives the next agent a voice calibration sample and continuity anchor._

_(Write "N/A" if no prose was written this session.)_

### Dangling Threads
- _Thread 1: what was introduced, intended resolution, target chapter_
- _Thread 2: what was introduced, intended resolution, target chapter_

_(Write "None" if no threads are dangling.)_

## Plan Lifecycle

```
Draft  ->  Active  ->  Completed
                   ->  Abandoned
```

- **Draft** -- Plan is being written but not yet approved for execution.
- **Active** -- Plan is approved and work is underway.
- **Completed** -- All success criteria met. Plan moved to `completed/`.
- **Abandoned** -- Plan was cancelled before completion. Moved to `completed/` with final status noted.

## How to Create a Plan

1. Copy `_TEMPLATE.md` to `active/PLAN-XXX.md` (assign the next available ID).
2. Fill in all metadata fields: Plan ID, Title, Status, Author, Created date, Updated date.
3. Define the Objective, Context, Approach, and Phases/Steps with clear acceptance criteria.
4. Set status to `Active` when ready to begin.
5. Add a row to the **Active Plans** table above.

## How to Complete a Plan

1. Verify all success criteria in the plan are met.
2. Set the plan's status to `Completed` (or `Abandoned` if cancelled).
3. Move the plan file from `active/` to `completed/`.
4. Move the row from the Active Plans table to the Completed Plans table above.

## Conventions

- **Plans are temporal.** They describe a bounded initiative with a clear start and end. They are not permanent reference documents.
- **One plan per initiative.** Do not combine unrelated work into a single plan.
- **Reference, don't duplicate.** Plans should link to docs, workflows, and outline contracts -- not copy their contents.
- **Update as you go.** Check off completed steps and update the plan's `Updated` date as work progresses.

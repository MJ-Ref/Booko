# Book_Map — Cursor Rules

## Project Type
Book authoring project managed by the Book_Map system.

## Key References
- Book overview: `docs/book/OVERVIEW.md`
- Chapter contracts: `docs/book/OUTLINE.md`
- Voice rules: `docs/book/VOICE_GUIDE.md`
- Style/terms: `docs/book/STYLE_SHEET.md`
- All docs: `docs/_INDEX.md`
- Manuscript status: `manuscript/_INDEX.md`
- Session state: `docs/session/SESSION_HANDOFF.md`

## Rules
1. `docs/` is the system of record — always defer to it.
2. `guide/` is read-only — never modify.
3. One editorial pass per session (don't mix drafting with editing).
4. Update `<!-- reviewed: YYYY-MM-DD -->` freshness tags on docs you modify.
5. Update `docs/session/SESSION_HANDOFF.md` at end of every session.
6. Chapter files require metadata: `<!-- status: -->`, `<!-- updated: -->`, `<!-- outline_ref: -->`.
7. Record irreversible editorial decisions as EDRs in `docs/decisions/EDR/`.
8. Run validation scripts before committing.

## Content Generation
- Check voice guide before writing prose
- Check style sheet for canonical terms
- Respect the chapter's editorial stage (don't line-edit during drafting)

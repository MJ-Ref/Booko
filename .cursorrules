# Book_Map — Cursor Entry Point

<!-- reviewed: 2026-02-13 -->

Book project managed by the Book_Map system. Route to docs/ for details.

## Key Files

- docs/_INDEX.md — master navigation
- docs/book/OVERVIEW.md — book purpose and audience
- books/book-01/docs/book/OUTLINE.md — chapter contracts (per-book)
- docs/book/VOICE_GUIDE.md — voice and tone rules (series-wide)
- docs/book/STYLE_SHEET.md — canonical terms and formatting (series-wide)
- books/_INDEX.md — series book status table
- series/SERIES_OVERVIEW.md — series overview and arc
- docs/session/SESSION_HANDOFF.md — session continuity
- docs/agent-guide/ONBOARDING.md — first-time orientation

## Rules

1. docs/ is the system of record.
2. guide/ is read-only.
3. One editorial pass per session.
4. Update freshness dates (<!-- reviewed: YYYY-MM-DD -->) on docs you touch.
5. Update session handoff at end of session.
6. Chapter files need metadata headers (status, updated, outline_ref).
7. Record irreversible editorial decisions as EDRs in docs/decisions/EDR/.

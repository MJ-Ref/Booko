<!--
  WHEN TO CREATE AN EDR:

  - Voice change: shifting tone, register, or narrative distance
  - Structure change: reordering chapters, merging/splitting sections,
    adding or removing parts
  - Terminology change: renaming a concept, character, or recurring term
  - POV change: switching point of view or narrative perspective
  - Canon rule: establishing a fact that must remain consistent
    (dates, places, character traits, scientific claims)
  - Style sheet update with non-obvious rationale: any style choice
    that a reasonable editor might question

  An EDR is NOT needed for:
  - Routine grammar or punctuation fixes
  - Typo corrections
  - Minor rephrasing that does not alter meaning or voice

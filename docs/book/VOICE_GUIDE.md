# Voice Guide

<!-- reviewed: 2026-02-13 -->

> This document defines the target voice for the manuscript. Every drafting and revision

## Voice Summary

<!-- 2-3 sentences that capture the voice. A writer should be able to read this and immediately calibrate. -->

[Example: "Conversational but precise. The voice of a knowledgeable friend who respects the reader's intelligence — no hand-holding, no jargon-for-jargon's-sake. Sentences land cleanly; humor is dry and infrequent."]

## Diction

## Rhetorical Habits

Describe recurring patterns in how the voice communicates:

- **Argumentation:** [How does the voice make a case? Data-first? Story-first? Dialectical?]
- **Description:** [Sparse and concrete? Lush and sensory? Metaphor-heavy?]
- **Transitions:** [Explicit signposting ("Next, we'll...") or implicit? White-space breaks?]
- **Evidence Presentation:** [Inline anecdotes? Footnotes? Block quotes? Sidebars?]
- **Reader Address:** [Direct ("you") or indirect? How often?]

## Voice Samples

<!-- Include 2-3 passages of 200-400 words each that exemplify the target voice. -->
<!-- These serve as calibration texts for any writer or agent working on the manuscript. -->

### Sample 1: [Context — e.g., "Explaining a core concept"]

> [Paste or write a 200-400 word passage here that demonstrates the voice at its best.
> This passage should feel like it belongs in the finished book.]

### Sample 2: [Context — e.g., "Narrative scene or anecdote"]

> [Paste or write a 200-400 word passage here.]

### Sample 3: [Context — e.g., "Handling a counterargument or difficult topic"]

> [Paste or write a 200-400 word passage here.]

## Character Voices (Fiction/Memoir)

<!-- Skip this section for nonfiction. For fiction or memoir, define how key characters
     deviate from the narrator voice. -->

| Character      | Voice Signature                                  | Differs From Narrator By...                     |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| [Character A]  | [e.g., clipped, blunt, avoids abstractions]      | [Shorter sentences, no metaphor, active voice only] |
| [Character B]  | [e.g., meandering, self-interrupting, verbose]   | [Longer sentences, frequent asides, passive voice OK] |
| [Character C]  | [e.g., formal, precise, emotionally guarded]     | [Latinate vocabulary, no contractions, understated emotion] |

---

## Voice Drift Indicators

Signs that the voice is slipping out of specification:

1. **Sentence length creep** — average exceeds [X] words for a sustained passage.
2. **Jargon accumulation** — undefined technical terms appearing without glossary support.
3. **Tone shift** — voice becomes [preachy / sarcastic / sentimental] without narrative justification.
4. **Register break** — sudden formality or informality inconsistent with baseline.
5. **POV contamination** — information leaks that the POV character cannot know.
6. **Adverb/adjective bloat** — decorative modifiers replacing precise nouns and verbs.

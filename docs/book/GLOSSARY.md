## Terms

<!-- Keep alphabetically sorted. Add new terms in the correct position. -->

| Term                | Definition                                                       | First Appears | Notes                          |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|--------------------------------|
| [Term A]            | [Clear, concise definition — one to two sentences max.]          | CH-01         | [Any caveats or disambiguation]|
| [Term B]            | [Definition. Avoid circular references to other undefined terms.] | CH-01         |                                |
| [Term C]            | [Definition.]                                                    | CH-02         | [Related to Term A but distinct]|
| [Term D]            | [Definition.]                                                    | CH-03         |                                |
| [Term E]            | [Definition.]                                                    | CH-03         | [Coined for this book]         |

## Conventions

- **One definition per term.** If a term has multiple meanings in the book, create separate entries (e.g., "Term (general)" and "Term (technical)").
- **First Appears** refers to the chapter where the term is first introduced and defined for the reader.
- **Definitions must be self-contained.** A reader should understand the definition without needing to read the chapter first.
- **Cross-references** are allowed: "See also: [Other Term]."

## How to Update

1. **Adding a new term:** Insert in alphabetical order. No EDR required.
2. **Changing an existing definition:** File an EDR. The old definition may already be in published or reviewed chapters.
3. **Removing a term:** File an EDR. Verify the term no longer appears in any manuscript file.
4. **Agents:** After drafting a chapter that introduces new terminology, update this glossary before marking the chapter as complete.

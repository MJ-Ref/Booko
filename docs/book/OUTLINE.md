# Book Outline — Chapter Contracts

<!-- reviewed: 2026-02-13 -->

> **Each chapter entry below is a CONTRACT, not just a heading.**
> A contract specifies the chapter's purpose, its promised takeaways, and its required elements.
> No chapter may be drafted until its contract is filled in. No chapter may be considered
> complete unless it delivers on every promised takeaway and includes every required element.
>
> To change a contract after drafting has begun, file an Editorial Decision Record (EDR).

- **Promised Takeaways:** What the reader gains by the end.
- **Required Elements:** Specific items that MUST appear (scenes, examples, exercises, etc.).
- **Estimated Word Count:** Target range.
- **Dependencies:** Chapters that must be read (or written) first.

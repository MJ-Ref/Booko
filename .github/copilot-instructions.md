## Key References

- Voice and tone: `docs/book/VOICE_GUIDE.md`

## When Generating Content

1. Check `docs/book/VOICE_GUIDE.md` for voice rules before writing prose.
2. Check `docs/book/STYLE_SHEET.md` for canonical terms and formatting.
3. Check chapter metadata headers for status and POV.
4. Do not modify files in `guide/` — it is read-only reference material.
5. Follow the editorial pass appropriate to the current stage.

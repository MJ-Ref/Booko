This is a template chapter file. It establishes the standard format for all chapters in the manuscript. Replace this placeholder text with actual chapter content once the outline contract for CH-01 has been written in `docs/book/OUTLINE.md`.

Before drafting, read the outline contract for this chapter and the voice guide at `docs/book/VOICE_GUIDE.md`. Follow the drafting workflow in `docs/workflows/DRAFTING.md` or the recipe in `docs/agent-guide/COMMON_TASKS.md`.

The content below this point is where the chapter body goes. Mark any uncertain or incomplete content with `<!-- TK: description -->` or `<!-- TODO: description -->` so it can be tracked by quality scripts.

<!-- BEGIN CHAPTER CONTENT -->

<!-- Follow the outline contract beats in order. -->
<!-- Use TK markers for content that needs research: <!-- TK: description --> -->
<!-- Use TODO markers for content that needs revision: <!-- TODO: description --> -->

<!-- END CHAPTER CONTENT -->

# Continuity Bible

> This document tracks all elements that must remain consistent across the manuscript:

## How to Update

1. **After every drafting session:** Review new content for introduced or modified elements. Update relevant tables above.
2. **New characters, locations, or objects:** Add immediately. Do not defer.
3. **Timeline changes:** Insert events in chronological order. Flag any resulting conflicts in Known Continuity Issues.
4. **World rule changes:** Require an EDR. A world rule, once established, is a contract with the reader.
5. **Agents:** Must read this file before drafting any chapter and update it after drafting completes. Failure to update is a process violation.

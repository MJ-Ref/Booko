# Continuity Bible

<!-- reviewed: 2026-02-13 -->

> **Primarily for fiction and memoir.** If this is a nonfiction project, this file is optional.
>
> This is the **tactical** continuity reference for this single book. It tracks every detail
> committed to in the manuscript: what was stated, where it was stated, and what must remain
> consistent going forward. The series-level documents (`series/CHARACTERS.md`,
> `series/WORLD.md`) hold the **strategic** truth — who characters are across the whole arc,
> what the world's rules are. This file is the ground-level record of what actually landed
> on the page in *this* book.
>
> **Why this level of detail?** Because the reader who notices the protagonist's eyes changed
> color between chapters 3 and 7 will never fully trust the narrative again. Continuity
> errors are trust fractures. This file prevents them.
>
> **Agents must read this file before drafting any chapter and update it after every drafting
> session that introduces or modifies tracked elements.**

## Timeline

<!-- WHY TRACK THIS: Timeline inconsistencies are the most common continuity error in fiction.
     "It was Tuesday" in one chapter and "three days later, on Wednesday" in the next will
     break the reader's immersion. Track elapsed time obsessively. For unreliable narrators,
     track both what the reader is told and what actually happened — the gap between them
     IS the story. -->

### Master Timeline

| Story Date | Day of Week | Time of Day | Event | Chapter | Elapsed Since Prior Scene | Notes |
|------------|-------------|-------------|-------|---------|--------------------------|-------|
| [March 14] | [Wednesday] | [7:30 AM] | [Elena finds the letter on the kitchen table] | CH-01 | [--] | [Book opens here; season is late winter] |
| [March 14] | [Wednesday] | [11:00 AM] | [Elena confronts David at his office] | CH-01 | [3.5 hours] | [Same day as opening] |
| [March 14] | [Wednesday] | [9:00 PM] | [Elena drives to her mother's house] | CH-02 | [10 hours] | [Night; streetlights on, described as cold] |
| [March 15] | [Thursday] | [6:00 AM] | [Elena wakes in her childhood bedroom] | CH-03 | [9 hours] | [Morning light through east-facing window] |
| [March 17] | [Saturday] | [2:00 PM] | [The confrontation at the park] | CH-04 | [2 days, 8 hours] | [Two days unaccounted for — bridge in CH-03 covers this with summary narration] |

<!-- For nonlinear narratives: "Story Date" is when it happens in the world. "Chapter" is
     when the reader encounters it. If those differ, the reader is experiencing the story
     out of chronological order — track both carefully. -->

### Unreliable Narrator Tracking

<!-- ONLY USE THIS if the narrator's account of events differs from objective reality.
     Delete this subsection if not applicable. -->

| Chapter | What the Reader Is Told | What Actually Happened | Discrepancy Revealed In | Notes |
|---------|------------------------|----------------------|------------------------|-------|
| [CH-03] | [Elena says she arrived at midnight] | [She arrived at 10 PM — two hours unaccounted for] | [CH-09] | [The missing hours are the inciting incident of Act Two] |
| [CH-05] | [David claims he was home all evening] | [David was at the harbor; confirmed by marina log] | [CH-11] | [Reader suspects earlier via sensory detail — salt air on his coat] |

## Characters in This Book

<!-- WHY TRACK THIS: series/CHARACTERS.md tracks who these people are across the whole arc.
     THIS section tracks what the reader of THIS book has been told about them. Every
     physical detail stated in prose is a commitment. Every emotional beat must track
     logically from what came before. An agent drafting CH-08 needs to know exactly what
     the reader already knows about a character from CH-01 through CH-07. -->

### Quick Reference

| Name | Role | First Appears | Last Appears | Status at Book End |
|------|------|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| [Elena Marsh] | [Protagonist] | CH-01 | CH-14 | [Alive; estranged from David; in possession of the letter] |
| [David Marsh] | [Antagonist] | CH-01 | CH-13 | [Alive; hospitalized after the fall; refusing to speak] |
| [June Marsh] | [Supporting — Elena's mother] | CH-02 | CH-12 | [Alive; secret revealed; relationship with Elena fractured] |
| [Tom Bellacourt] | [Supporting — detective] | CH-04 | CH-14 | [Alive; case still open; developing trust with Elena] |
| [Ava Chen] | [Minor — neighbor] | CH-06 | CH-06 | [Alive; single appearance; witness to the argument] |

---

### Detailed Character Sheet: [Elena Marsh]

<!-- COPY THIS ENTIRE TEMPLATE for each major character in the book.
     Minor characters (single scene, no arc) only need a row in the Quick Reference table. -->

#### State at Book Start

- **Physical Appearance:** [5'6", dark brown hair to shoulders, brown eyes, thin build. Favors practical clothing — jeans, boots, layered sweaters. No jewelry except a plain silver band on her right hand.]
- **Health / Injuries:** [Healthy. Chronic insomnia mentioned in narration — dark circles under her eyes.]
- **Emotional State:** [Guarded, fatigued, operating on routine. Marriage feels hollow but she hasn't named the feeling yet.]
- **What They Want:** [Surface: normalcy. Deeper: to feel something real again.]
- **Knowledge State:**
  - **Knows:** [That David has been working late. That her mother disapproves of her marriage. That the old house on Fern Street is for sale.]
  - **Does Not Know:** [That David is involved with the harbor project. That June has been in contact with David's employer. That the letter exists.]

#### Physical Details Committed to in Text

<!-- CRITICAL: Once a physical detail appears in drafted prose, it is LOCKED. Track every one.
     An agent drafting CH-10 who gives Elena blue eyes when CH-01 said brown eyes has
     created a trust-breaking error. -->

| Detail | Chapter | Page/Paragraph | Exact Phrasing |
|--------|---------|----------------|----------------|
| [Brown eyes] | CH-01 | [p. 3, para 2] | ["her brown eyes scanning the return address"] |
| [Scar on left palm] | CH-04 | [p. 12, para 1] | ["the pale scar across her palm where the glass had caught her at fourteen"] |
| [Wears reading glasses] | CH-06 | [p. 2, para 4] | ["she pushed her glasses up her nose"] |
| [Silver band on right hand] | CH-01 | [p. 7, para 3] | ["turning the silver band on her right ring finger — not a wedding ring, she always said"] |

#### Clothing and Appearance by Chapter

<!-- WHY: A character who is wearing a red coat in the first scene of a chapter cannot be
     wearing a blue jacket in the second scene unless they changed. Track what they're
     wearing when the reader sees them. -->

| Chapter | What They're Wearing / Appearance Notes |
|---------|----------------------------------------|
| [CH-01] | [Gray cable-knit sweater, jeans, brown leather boots. Hair down. Glasses off.] |
| [CH-02] | [Same sweater from CH-01 (she hasn't changed — continuous timeline). Hair now pulled back.] |
| [CH-03] | [Old high school t-shirt from her mother's house — "Ridgemont Cougars." Barefoot.] |
| [CH-04] | [Black pea coat, scarf. Formal enough for a police station. Glasses on.] |

#### Emotional Journey

<!-- Track the emotional temperature chapter by chapter. This prevents jarring tonal shifts —
     a character who was devastated at the end of CH-05 cannot be cheerful at the start of
     CH-06 without a reason. -->

| Chapter | Emotional State | Key Driver | Notes |
|---------|----------------|------------|-------|
| [CH-01] | [Numb, going through motions] | [Discovers the letter] | [Shock cracks the numbness] |
| [CH-02] | [Angry, activated] | [Confrontation with David yielded nothing] | [First time she's felt alive in months] |
| [CH-03] | [Vulnerable, regressed] | [Childhood bedroom triggers memories] | [Drops her guard with June — briefly] |
| [CH-04] | [Determined, guarded] | [Meeting with Bellacourt gives her a framework] | [Channeling anger into action] |

#### Key Decisions and Turning Points

| Chapter | Decision / Turning Point | Why It Matters |
|---------|------------------------|----------------|
| [CH-01] | [Opens the letter instead of showing it to David first] | [Establishes her as someone who acts alone — setup for Act Two isolation] |
| [CH-06] | [Lies to Bellacourt about what she found at the harbor] | [First moral compromise; reader trust shifts] |
| [CH-10] | [Returns to David's hospital room despite everything] | [Reversal; signals her arc toward compassion over justice] |

#### What They Learn During the Book

| Chapter | New Knowledge Acquired | Source | Shared With |
|---------|----------------------|--------|-------------|
| [CH-01] | [The letter exists and names a person she doesn't recognize] | [Found on kitchen table] | [No one yet] |
| [CH-04] | [David's employer is connected to the harbor project] | [Bellacourt's case file] | [June, in CH-05 — a mistake] |
| [CH-09] | [June knew about the letter before Elena found it] | [June admits it] | [Bellacourt, in CH-10] |

#### State at Book End

- **Physical Appearance:** [Same as start, plus: hair cut short in CH-11 (symbolic act). New scar on right forearm from CH-13 incident.]
- **Health / Injuries:** [Forearm laceration (CH-13, stitched at ER). Insomnia worsened — now on medication.]
- **Emotional State:** [Exhausted but clear-eyed. Grief has replaced anger. Not healed, but honest.]
- **What They Want Now:** [To understand why June kept the secret. To decide whether to testify.]
- **Knowledge State at Book End:**
  - **Now Knows:** [Everything about the harbor project. David's role. June's complicity. Bellacourt's personal stake.]
  - **Still Does Not Know:** [Who actually wrote the letter. Whether David's fall was an accident.]

<!-- COPY the template above for each additional major character. -->

[Repeat the full template structure: State at Book Start, Physical Details Committed,

## Character Relationships in This Book

<!-- WHY TRACK THIS: Relationships are state machines. They have a condition at the start of
     the book and a condition at the end, and the transitions between must be motivated and
     trackable. Information asymmetry — what A knows about B vs. what B knows about A —
     is where dramatic tension lives. -->

| Character A | Character B | Status at Book Start | Key Interactions (with Chapter Refs) | How It Changes | Status at Book End | A Knows About B | B Knows About A |
|-------------|-------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| [Elena] | [David] | [Married, distant, co-habiting] | [CH-01: confrontation over letter. CH-07: Elena visits his office after hours. CH-13: the fall.] | [Trust collapses incrementally; pity replaces love by end] | [Estranged; Elena has not filed for divorce but has moved out] | [Knows about harbor project, his employer, his lies] | [Does not know Elena lied to Bellacourt; does not know Elena found the marina log] |
| [Elena] | [June] | [Strained but functional; weekly phone calls] | [CH-02: Elena arrives at June's house. CH-05: Elena tells June about employer. CH-09: June's confession.] | [Brief closeness in CH-02-03 shattered by CH-09 revelation] | [Not speaking; Elena feels betrayed; June feels justified] | [Knows June kept the secret; suspects more] | [Knows Elena is investigating; does not know about Bellacourt] |
| [Elena] | [Bellacourt] | [Strangers] | [CH-04: first meeting at station. CH-06: Elena lies to him. CH-10: Elena tells him the truth.] | [Professional to cautious trust; Elena's lie creates a setback] | [Allied but wary; mutual respect, not yet friendship] | [Knows his case background; suspects personal stake] | [Knows most of what Elena knows — except the marina log] |

---

## Locations in This Book

<!-- WHY TRACK THIS: Every sensory detail committed to in text is a contract with the reader.
     If the kitchen has yellow walls in CH-02, they must be yellow in CH-09. If the garden
     smells of lavender, it cannot smell of roses two chapters later (unless the roses were
     just planted — and you'd better have tracked that). -->

### Location: [Elena and David's House — 14 Fern Street]

- **First Appears:** [CH-01]
- **Physical Description Committed to in Text:**
  | Detail | Chapter | Exact Phrasing |
  |--------|---------|----------------|
  | [Two-story colonial, white clapboard] | [CH-01] | ["the white clapboard house looked gray in the early light"] |
  | [Red front door] | [CH-01] | ["the red door she'd painted herself the summer they moved in"] |
  | [Kitchen: yellow walls, butcher-block island] | [CH-01] | ["sunlight on the yellow walls made the kitchen the only warm room"] |
  | [Creaky third stair] | [CH-05] | ["she skipped the third stair out of habit — it had groaned since they moved in"] |

- **Sensory Details Committed:**
  | Sense | Detail | Chapter |
  |-------|--------|---------|
  | [Sight] | [Morning light enters kitchen from east-facing window] | [CH-01] |
  | [Sound] | [Third stair creaks] | [CH-05] |
  | [Smell] | [Kitchen smells of coffee and old wood] | [CH-01] |
  | [Touch] | [Butcher block has a smooth divot from years of knife work] | [CH-03] |

- **Layout / Geography:** [Kitchen on ground floor, east side. Bedroom upstairs, front of house. David's study is in the back — door locks from inside (noted CH-05). Backyard has a garden, currently dormant (March).]

- **Who's Associated:** [Elena and David live here. June visits in CH-07. Bellacourt comes to the door but is not invited inside (CH-08).]

- **Key Scenes Set Here:**
  | Chapter | Scene | Time of Day | Weather/Season |
  |---------|-------|-------------|----------------|
  | [CH-01] | [Elena finds the letter] | [7:30 AM] | [Overcast, cold, late winter] |
  | [CH-05] | [Elena searches David's study] | [11:00 PM] | [Clear night, house dark] |
  | [CH-12] | [Elena packs a bag and leaves] | [Dawn] | [First day of spring warmth — ironic] |

- **How the Location Changes:** [Increasingly disordered as Elena's life unravels. By CH-10, dishes in the sink, mail piling up. The garden remains dormant — never blooms in the book's timeline.]

### Location: [Location Name]

<!-- COPY the full template above for each significant location. Incidental locations
     (a coffee shop in one scene) only need a note in the Scene-by-Scene Continuity Log. -->

Associations, Key Scenes, Changes.]

## World Rules Active in This Book

<!-- WHY TRACK THIS: series/WORLD.md defines the rules of the world. This section tracks
     which of those rules actually come into play in THIS book — which ones are tested,
     invoked, or challenged. It also captures any NEW rules this book establishes that
     must be added back to series/WORLD.md. -->

### Rules Invoked from series/WORLD.md

| Rule | How It's Invoked in This Book | Chapter | Notes |
|------|------------------------------|---------|-------|
| [The town has no cell service north of the ridge] | [Elena cannot call for help during the harbor scene] | [CH-08] | [Plot-critical; this constraint drives the isolation] |
| [Police department is understaffed — one detective] | [Bellacourt is alone on the case, overworked] | [CH-04] | [Explains why Elena's help is tolerated] |

### New Rules Established in This Book

<!-- These must be added to series/WORLD.md after this book is finalized. -->

| Rule | Established In | Impact | Added to series/WORLD.md? |
|------|---------------|--------|--------------------------|
| [The harbor is restricted after 6 PM by city ordinance] | [CH-06] | [Means David's presence there at night is inherently suspicious] | [Pending] |
| [The old quarry road floods in spring] | [CH-11] | [Blocks Elena's escape route — forces confrontation] | [Pending] |

### Rules Bent or Challenged

<!-- Track any moment where a world rule is pushed to its limits or appears to be contradicted.
     If the rule truly breaks, file an EDR. -->

| Rule | How It's Challenged | Chapter | Resolution |
|------|-------------------|---------|------------|
| [No cell service north of ridge] | [Elena gets one bar briefly during a storm — atmospheric interference?] | [CH-10] | [One partial text message sent; rule not broken, just bent. Plausible.] |

---

## Objects and Significant Items

<!-- WHY TRACK THIS: Objects carry meaning. A gun introduced in Act One must fire in Act Three
     (or its absence must be meaningful). Track where the reader last saw every significant
     item — if a character pulls out a key in CH-12, the reader must have seen that key
     enter their possession. -->

### Object: [The Letter]

- **Physical Description:**
  | Detail | Chapter | Exact Phrasing |
  |--------|---------|----------------|
  | [Cream-colored envelope, no return address] | [CH-01] | ["a cream envelope, unmarked, propped against the sugar bowl"] |
  | [Handwritten in blue ink, neat script] | [CH-01] | ["the handwriting was precise, almost architectural — blue ink on unlined paper"] |
  | [Two pages, folded in thirds] | [CH-01] | ["two pages, folded in exact thirds, the creases sharp as if ironed"] |

- **Current Location / Possession:** [Elena's coat pocket as of CH-04. Moved to her bag in CH-06. Given to Bellacourt in CH-10. Bellacourt has it through book end.]

- **Symbolic Meaning:** [The letter represents suppressed truth. Its physical movement tracks who controls the narrative — possession is agency.]

- **Scenes Involving This Object:**
  | Chapter | Scene | What Happens to It |
  |---------|-------|--------------------|
  | [CH-01] | [Discovery on kitchen table] | [Elena opens and reads it] |
  | [CH-04] | [Meeting with Bellacourt] | [Elena mentions it but does not show it] |
  | [CH-10] | [Elena gives it to Bellacourt] | [Transfer of evidence — and of burden] |

- **Where the Reader Last Saw It:** [CH-10, in Bellacourt's hands at the police station.]

### Object: [Object Name]

<!-- COPY the full template above for each significant object. -->

[Repeat the full template structure: Physical Description, Location, Symbolic Meaning,
Scenes, Last Seen.]

## Scene-by-Scene Continuity Log

<!-- WHY TRACK THIS: This is the atomic-level continuity tracker. When an agent sits down to
     draft CH-09, they need to know: What time is it? Where are we? Who's here? What's the
     weather? What happened immediately before this scene? What must carry forward?
     Without this log, continuity errors are inevitable. -->

| Chapter | Scene | Story Date/Time | Location | Characters Present | Weather / Environment | Key Continuity Details to Carry Forward |
|---------|-------|----------------|----------|-------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------|
| [CH-01, Scene 1] | [Elena finds the letter] | [March 14, 7:30 AM] | [14 Fern Street, kitchen] | [Elena alone] | [Overcast, cold, 38F. Late winter. No snow on ground.] | [Letter is cream, blue ink. Kitchen has yellow walls. Elena is in gray sweater.] |
| [CH-01, Scene 2] | [Elena confronts David at office] | [March 14, 11:00 AM] | [Marsh & Associates, downtown] | [Elena, David, receptionist (unnamed)] | [Same day, still overcast. Fluorescent office lighting.] | [David is in a navy suit. His office has a harbor view. He denies knowledge of the letter.] |
| [CH-02, Scene 1] | [Elena drives to June's house] | [March 14, 9:00 PM] | [Route 9 / June's house, Ridgemont] | [Elena alone, then Elena and June] | [Night, clear, cold. Streetlights along Route 9. Porch light on at June's.] | [Elena still in gray sweater from CH-01. June answers in a bathrobe. 40-minute drive.] |
| [CH-03, Scene 1] | [Elena wakes in childhood bedroom] | [March 15, 6:00 AM] | [June's house, upstairs bedroom] | [Elena alone] | [Morning, east light through window. Frost on glass.] | [Elena wearing old Ridgemont Cougars t-shirt. Room has twin bed, still has her high school desk.] |

<!-- Continue this log for every scene. This is the most labor-intensive section but also
     the most valuable. An error caught here saves a revision pass later. -->

---

## Sensory Commitments

<!-- WHY TRACK THIS: Sensory details are the most insidious continuity traps. A reader may
     not consciously remember that the kitchen smelled of coffee, but they WILL feel
     cognitive dissonance if it suddenly smells of lavender with no explanation. Once a
     sensory detail is committed to in prose, it is locked for that location, character,
     or object for the rest of the book (unless the change is narrated). -->

### By Location

| Location | Sense | Committed Detail | Chapter | Exact Phrasing |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------|----------------|
| [14 Fern Street — kitchen] | [Sight] | [Yellow walls; east-facing window; butcher-block island] | [CH-01] | [Multiple — see Location entry] |
| [14 Fern Street — kitchen] | [Smell] | [Coffee and old wood] | [CH-01] | ["the smell of coffee and old wood that she'd stopped noticing years ago"] |
| [14 Fern Street — staircase] | [Sound] | [Third stair creaks] | [CH-05] | ["the third stair groaned under her weight"] |
| [June's house — bedroom] | [Sight] | [East-facing window, frost on glass] | [CH-03] | ["morning light through the east window, frost feathering the glass"] |
| [June's house — bedroom] | [Smell] | [Lavender and mothballs] | [CH-03] | ["the room still smelled of her mother's lavender sachets and something sharper underneath — mothballs, maybe"] |
| [Harbor — dock area] | [Sound] | [Rigging clanking against masts] | [CH-06] | ["the hollow clank of rigging against aluminum masts"] |
| [Harbor — dock area] | [Smell] | [Salt, diesel, fish] | [CH-06] | ["salt and diesel and the low stink of old fish"] |

### By Character

| Character | Sense | Committed Detail | Chapter | Exact Phrasing |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|---------|----------------|
| [David] | [Smell] | [Salt air on his coat] | [CH-05] | ["his coat smelled of salt air, though he said he'd been at the office"] |
| [June] | [Sound] | [Voice goes flat when she's lying] | [CH-09] | ["her voice went flat — the same dead-level tone Elena remembered from childhood"] |
| [Bellacourt] | [Sight] | [Pen-clicking habit] | [CH-04] | ["he clicked the pen against the desk in a rhythm that might have been Morse code"] |

<!-- Sensory commitments for objects are tracked in the Objects section above. -->

---

## Known Continuity Issues

<!-- WHY TRACK THIS: No manuscript is perfect during drafting. When you spot a contradiction
     or gap, log it here IMMEDIATELY rather than trying to fix it on the fly. Severity levels
     help prioritize resolution during revision. Transfer critical issues to the Editorial
     Debt Register for formal tracking. -->

| ID | Issue | Severity | Chapters Affected | Impact Assessment | Status | Resolution |
|----|-------|----------|-------------------|-------------------|--------|------------|
| [CI-01] | [Elena's coat changes from black pea coat to gray parka between CH-04 and CH-06] | [High — reader will notice] | [CH-04, CH-06] | [Physical description contradiction; one must be corrected] | [Open] | [Pending — standardize to black pea coat; update CH-06 draft] |
| [CI-02] | [Timeline gap: March 15-17 lacks bridging narration] | [Medium — reader may lose temporal footing] | [CH-03, CH-04] | [Two days pass with no narrative coverage; needs summary or scene] | [Open] | [Add brief summary passage at end of CH-03] |
| [CI-03] | [Bellacourt references "the marina log" in CH-08 but Elena doesn't find it until CH-09] | [Critical — temporal impossibility] | [CH-08, CH-09] | [Information cannot precede its discovery; scene order may need swapping] | [Open] | [Pending — requires outline adjustment; flag in EDR] |

**Severity Levels:**
- **Critical** — Temporal impossibility, character in two places at once, dead character appears alive. Must fix before any further drafting in affected chapters.
- **High** — Physical description contradiction, sensory detail conflict, relationship state error. Fix during next revision pass.
- **Medium** — Timeline gap, unclear elapsed time, minor setting inconsistency. Fix during full manuscript review.
- **Low** — Stylistic inconsistency, optional detail conflict (e.g., weather mentioned once, not contradicted but not carried forward). Address if time permits.

See: [EDITORIAL_DEBT_REGISTER.md](../../../../docs/quality/EDITORIAL_DEBT_REGISTER.md) for full issue tracking.

## How to Update

<!-- This section defines the triggers that should prompt an update to each section.
     Agents must treat these triggers as mandatory checkpoints. -->

| Trigger | Sections to Update |
|---------|-------------------|
| **A new scene is drafted** | Timeline, Scene-by-Scene Continuity Log |
| **A character appears for the first time** | Characters Quick Reference, begin Detailed Character Sheet |
| **A physical detail about a character is stated in prose** | Detailed Character Sheet (Physical Details Committed) |
| **A character changes clothing or appearance** | Detailed Character Sheet (Clothing by Chapter) |
| **A character makes a decision or learns something** | Detailed Character Sheet (Key Decisions, What They Learn) |
| **A character's emotional state shifts** | Detailed Character Sheet (Emotional Journey) |
| **Two characters interact** | Character Relationships |
| **A location is described for the first time** | Locations (begin full Location template) |
| **A sensory detail is stated in prose** | Sensory Commitments, and the relevant Location entry |
| **A significant object appears** | Objects and Significant Items |
| **A world rule is invoked, established, or tested** | World Rules Active in This Book |
| **A continuity error is spotted** | Known Continuity Issues (log immediately, do not defer) |
| **A chapter draft is completed** | ALL sections — full review pass against new content |

### Update Protocol

1. **Before drafting:** Read the Scene-by-Scene Continuity Log for the most recent scene, plus the Detailed Character Sheet for every character who will appear.
2. **During drafting:** If you commit a new sensory detail, physical description, or timeline detail to prose, note it for post-draft update.
3. **After drafting:** Walk through every section in this file. Update every table that was affected by the new content. This is not optional.
4. **When in doubt:** Log it in Known Continuity Issues. A false alarm is better than a missed error.
5. **World rule changes:** Require an EDR. A world rule, once established, is a contract with the reader.
6. **Series-level changes:** If anything in this book changes information that exists in `series/CHARACTERS.md` or `series/WORLD.md`, update those files too and note the change in `series/RETROACTIVE_LOG.md`.

## Status Values

Books progress through these statuses sequentially:

1. **Planning** -- Series arc role defined, outline in progress, no manuscript content yet
2. **Draft** -- Manuscript drafting underway from outline contracts
3. **Dev-Edited** -- Developmental edit pass completed (structure, pacing, argument flow)
4. **Line-Edited** -- Line edit pass completed (clarity, voice, sentence-level quality)
5. **Copy-Edited** -- Copy edit pass completed (grammar, formatting, consistency)
6. **Final** -- All editorial passes complete; accepted by Lead Author Agent
7. **Published** -- Book is published and available to readers

---

## Rules for Updating

1. **Status must match the most advanced editorial stage completed for the book.** If all chapters are Dev-Edited, the book status is Dev-Edited.
2. **Word count must reflect the current manuscript total.** Update after each drafting or editing session that changes word count.
3. **Chapter count must match the number of chapter files in the manuscript directory.**
4. **Last Updated must be the date of the most recent change to any of the book's fields.**
5. **A book cannot advance to a status until ALL chapters have reached that status.** If 11 of 12 chapters are Line-Edited but one is still Dev-Edited, the book status remains Dev-Edited.
6. **Before moving a book to Final or Published,** verify all series-level documents are consistent: [CHARACTERS.md](../series/CHARACTERS.md), [WORLD.md](../series/WORLD.md), [TIMELINE.md](../series/TIMELINE.md), [THREADS.md](../series/THREADS.md).

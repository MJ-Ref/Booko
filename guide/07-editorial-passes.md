# Chapter 7: Editorial Passes

<!-- reviewed: 2026-02-13 -->

---

## The Challenge

Without a defined editorial process, agent-assisted book projects fall into one
of two traps.

**The polishing trap.** Every session revisits every paragraph. The agent
rewrites sentences that were already fine. The author requests changes to
chapter two while chapter twelve has not been drafted. The manuscript is
endlessly refined and never finished. Perfectionism masquerades as quality
control, and the book never reaches the reader.

**The first-draft-is-final trap.** The agent produces a complete draft. The
author reads it, finds it "pretty good," and declares it done. No structural
review. No voice consistency check. No careful sentence-level editing. The book
publishes with the kind of problems that a competent editor would have caught
in a single read -- a sagging middle, an unconvincing character turn in chapter
nine, a tonal shift in part three that nobody noticed because nobody read the
whole thing with fresh eyes.

The publishing industry evolved a multi-stage editorial process over centuries
because books need it. A single pass cannot address structure, voice, grammar,
pacing, and production simultaneously. The brain (human or artificial) that is
evaluating whether chapter seven should come before chapter six cannot
simultaneously catch a misplaced comma on page forty-three. Different editorial
concerns require different modes of attention.

## The Principle

Editorial work is a sequence of distinct passes, each with a different focus,
different tools, and different acceptance criteria. Mixing passes produces
chaos -- you fix a comma in a paragraph that should be deleted, you restructure
a chapter whose prose has not been drafted yet, you polish sentences in a
section that needs to be rewritten from scratch.

The cardinal rule: **Never do fine-grained work on material that has not passed
coarse-grained review.** Do not line-edit a chapter that has not survived
developmental editing. Do not copy-edit a paragraph that has not been
line-edited. Do not proofread a page that has not been copy-edited.

Work from large to small. Structure before sentences. Sentences before commas.

## In Practice

### The Five Editorial Stages

#### Stage 1: Drafting

**Focus:** Get the content down. Produce raw material for every chapter,
scene, or section specified in the structure spec.

**Tools:**
- Voice spec (as guardrails, not as a perfectionism engine)
- Structure spec (as a map for what each chapter must accomplish)
- Character specs / argument map (as reference for what goes where)
- Pacing map (as general guidance, not rigid constraint)

**Mode:** Momentum priority. Forward motion is the primary virtue. It is
better to write an imperfect chapter and move on than to write a perfect
paragraph and stall. A draft exists to be revised. It does not need to be
good. It needs to exist.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- Every chapter/section in the structure spec has a draft
- The draft covers all major plot points, arguments, or narrative beats
- The voice is approximately right (within the general territory of the spec)
- The draft is complete enough to evaluate structurally

**What NOT to do during drafting:**
- Do not stop to perfect sentences
- Do not go back to revise earlier chapters
- Do not agonize over word choice
- Do not check grammar or spelling
- Do not worry about transitions between sections

**Plan integration:** Each drafting plan specifies a chapter or section to
draft, references the relevant specs, and has a word count target. Acceptance
is based on completeness, not quality.

#### Stage 2: Developmental Edit

**Focus:** Structure, pacing, arc coherence. Does the book work as a whole?
Do the parts serve the whole? Is anything missing, redundant, or misplaced?

**Tools:**
- Structure spec (primary tool -- the book is evaluated against this)
- Pacing map (does the actual pacing match the intended pacing?)
- Character arcs / argument map (are arcs complete and coherent?)

**Mode:** Surgical. Read the entire manuscript (or a complete part) with the
structure spec in hand. Evaluate each chapter against its structural purpose.
Identify problems at the chapter, part, and whole-book level.

**Developmental edit produces:**
- A list of structural changes (chapters to add, remove, reorder, split, merge)
- Arc completion assessment (which character/argument arcs are incomplete?)
- Pacing diagnosis (where does the book sag, rush, or flatline?)
- A revised structure spec (if structural changes are needed)
- Specific revision plans for each chapter that needs rework

**Acceptance criteria:**
- Every chapter serves a clear structural purpose
- No major gaps in character arcs, argument progression, or narrative logic
- Pacing matches the pacing map (within reasonable variation)
- The midpoint works (provides energy for the second half)
- The ending is earned (set up by everything that precedes it)
- The structure spec has been updated to reflect any changes

**What NOT to do during developmental editing:**
- Do not fix sentences -- you may cut the paragraph they are in
- Do not correct grammar -- the passage may be rewritten entirely
- Do not optimize word choice -- the section may be moved or removed

#### Stage 3: Line Edit

**Focus:** Sentence-level craft. Voice consistency. Paragraph construction.
Transitions. Rhythm. The prose itself.

**Tools:**
- Voice spec (primary tool -- every sentence is checked against this)
- Voice sample library (reference for what "right" sounds like)
- Pacing map (for sentence-level rhythm guidance)

**Mode:** Close reading. Read every sentence. Check it against the voice spec.
Listen to the rhythm. Evaluate transitions between paragraphs and sections.
This is the slowest pass and the one where craft is most directly applied.

**Line edit addresses:**
- Voice consistency (diction, register, rhythm match the spec)
- Sentence quality (clarity, precision, energy)
- Paragraph construction (topic sentences, flow, appropriate length)
- Transitions (between paragraphs, between scenes, between chapters)
- Redundancy (saying the same thing twice in different words)
- Cliche (phrases so familiar they have lost their meaning)
- Show vs. tell (are feelings demonstrated through action and detail, or
  merely stated?)

**Acceptance criteria:**
- The prose consistently matches the voice spec
- Every sentence earns its place (no deadwood, no filler)
- Transitions are smooth and purposeful
- The rhythm varies appropriately across the chapter
- A random page, read aloud, sounds like the voice spec intended

**What NOT to do during line editing:**
- Do not restructure chapters (that was the developmental edit)
- Do not add or remove major content (that was the developmental edit)
- Do not check spelling or formatting (that is the copy edit)

#### Stage 4: Copy Edit

**Focus:** Grammar, spelling, punctuation, formatting, internal consistency.
Factual accuracy. Zero errors.

**Tools:**
- Style guide (if one exists for the project)
- Character specs (for name/detail consistency)
- Timeline (for chronological consistency)
- Source documents (for factual verification in nonfiction)

**Mode:** Mechanical precision. Read every word. Check every fact. Verify
every name, date, and detail. This is not a creative pass -- it is a quality
assurance pass.

**Copy edit addresses:**
- Grammar and punctuation errors
- Spelling errors (including character and place name consistency)
- Formatting consistency (heading levels, paragraph spacing, list styles)
- Internal consistency (a character's eyes do not change color, a date
  mentioned in chapter three matches the date mentioned in chapter eleven)
- Factual accuracy (for nonfiction: are the facts correct? are quotes
  accurate? are statistics current?)
- Style consistency (serial comma or not, number formatting, capitalization
  rules)

**Acceptance criteria:**
- Zero grammatical errors
- Zero spelling errors
- Zero internal inconsistencies
- All facts verified (nonfiction)
- Formatting is consistent throughout

**What NOT to do during copy editing:**
- Do not rewrite sentences for style (that was the line edit)
- Do not restructure (that was the developmental edit)
- Do not make creative changes of any kind

#### Stage 5: Proofread and Production

**Focus:** Final formatting. Front matter and back matter. Production
readiness.

**Tools:**
- Publishing format requirements (print, ebook, or both)
- Front matter template (title page, copyright, dedication, table of contents)
- Back matter template (acknowledgments, notes, bibliography, index, about
  the author)

**Mode:** Final review. Read the formatted manuscript for any errors
introduced during formatting. Check page breaks, headers, footers, and
running heads. Verify hyperlinks (for ebooks). Check image placement and
captions.

**Production tasks:**
- Front matter creation (title page, copyright page, dedication, epigraph,
  table of contents, foreword/preface if applicable)
- Back matter creation (acknowledgments, notes/endnotes, bibliography/
  references, index, about the author)
- Final formatting for target publication format
- ISBN and metadata preparation
- Cover copy (jacket text, back cover blurb)

**Acceptance criteria:**
- All front and back matter is complete and correctly formatted
- No errors introduced during formatting
- The book is ready for the target publication format
- All metadata is complete and accurate

### The No-Mixing Rule

This is the most important operational rule in the editorial system:

**Never do work from a later stage on material that has not completed the
current stage.**

In practice this means:

- Do not line-edit a chapter that has not been developmentally edited. You will
  polish prose that gets cut or rewritten.
- Do not copy-edit a chapter that has not been line-edited. You will correct
  grammar in sentences that get replaced.
- Do not proofread material that has not been copy-edited. You will verify
  formatting that gets changed.

The exception: if you notice a factual error or a serious continuity problem
during any pass, note it. But do not fix it unless it is within the scope of
the current pass.

### Stage Gates

A stage gate is a checkpoint between stages. Before moving from one stage to
the next, verify that the acceptance criteria for the current stage are met.

The stage gate process:

1. Review the acceptance criteria for the current stage.
2. Evaluate the manuscript against each criterion.
3. List any criteria that are not met.
4. Either address the gaps (staying in the current stage) or accept them as
   known limitations and document them.
5. Update the editorial status tracker.
6. Begin the next stage.

Stage gates prevent premature advancement. A book that enters line editing
before developmental editing is complete will waste effort polishing material
that needs structural revision.

### The Editorial Status Tracker

The editorial status tracker lives at `docs/editorial-status.md` and records
the current editorial stage for each chapter.

## By Book Type

### Fiction

**Developmental edit focus:** Plot and character arc coherence. Pacing. Scene
necessity (does every scene advance plot, character, or both?). Subplot
integration. Midpoint and climax effectiveness. Foreshadowing and payoff.
Setup and resolution of promises made to the reader.

**Line edit focus:** Voice consistency between narration and the voice spec.
Dialogue distinctiveness (does each character sound different?). Show vs. tell
(are emotions dramatized or stated?). Sensory detail (is the reader grounded
in the physical world of the story?). Rhythm variation.

**Copy edit includes continuity.** Fiction copy editing must catch continuity
errors: a character who was wearing a blue shirt in one scene and a red shirt
two pages later. A sunset that happens twice in one evening. A character who
knows something they should not know yet. These errors are invisible to the
agent in any single session but glaring to a reader.

### Nonfiction

**Developmental edit focus:** Argument coherence. Does each chapter build on
the previous one? Are all premises established before the conclusions that
depend on them? Is the evidence sufficient and varied? Are counterarguments
addressed fairly? Does the reader's journey make sense?

**Line edit focus:** Clarity above all. Is every sentence unambiguous? Are
technical terms defined? Is the prose accessible to the target audience? Is
the author's voice consistent with the authority and accessibility balance
defined in the voice spec?

**Copy edit includes fact-checking.** Nonfiction copy editing must verify
facts, quotes, statistics, and dates. Every factual claim should be traceable
to a source. Agents should flag claims they cannot verify so the author can
provide sources or remove the claim.

### Memoir

**Developmental edit focus:** Narrative arc and emotional truth. Does the
memoir tell a complete story? Does the author-as-character change? Is the
thematic throughline clear? Are the reflective passages earning their place
(providing insight, not just commentary)? Is the balance between then-voice
and now-voice working?

**Line edit focus:** The two-voice challenge. The now-voice and the then-voice
must be distinct but harmonious. The line edit checks that the distinction is
maintained, that transitions between them are handled gracefully, and that
neither voice overwhelms the other.

**Copy edit includes sensitivity review.** Memoir copy editing should include
a sensitivity pass: are real people portrayed fairly? Are any portrayals
potentially libelous? Has the author honored any agreements about what would
and would not be included? Are there passages that could cause harm that the
author may not have considered from the other person's perspective?

The sensitivity review is not censorship. It is informed consent and ethical
awareness. The author may choose to keep a passage after the sensitivity
review, but that choice should be deliberate, not inadvertent.

# Chapter 11: Quality Scorecard -- Four Dimensions of Book Quality

<!-- reviewed: 2026-02-13 -->

> **Pattern:** Decompose book quality into four evaluable dimensions -- Voice
> Consistency, Structural Integrity, Substance, and Project Health -- each scored
> on a 1-5 rubric. Use the scorecard at stage gates and during spot checks to
> replace subjective impression with systematic assessment.

## The Challenge

"Good writing" is subjective. Ask five readers whether a book is well-written
and you will get five answers shaped by personal taste, genre expectations, and
mood. This subjectivity is fine for readers. It is not fine for a production
system that needs to evaluate whether a manuscript is ready to advance from one
editorial stage to the next.

Without explicit quality dimensions, editorial feedback becomes taste rather than
craft. An agent told "this chapter isn't working" has no actionable information.
An agent told "voice consistency has drifted in sections 3-5 -- the narrator
shifts from close third to distant third without motivation" can fix the problem
in a single session.

The challenge is sharper for agent-assisted writing because the feedback loop
is mediated by documents. A human editor and a human writer can have a
conversation, read body language, iterate verbally. An agent receives written
criteria and produces written output. The criteria must be specific enough that
the agent can self-assess and specific enough that the author can evaluate
without relying on gut feeling alone.

This does not mean reducing art to arithmetic. It means supplementing artistic
judgment with systematic evaluation. The scorecard does not replace the author's
ear -- it gives the author's ear a vocabulary and a framework.

## The Principle

**Book quality can be decomposed into measurable dimensions.** Not all
quantifiable, but all evaluable against a rubric. Each dimension captures a
distinct aspect of quality that can be assessed independently. A book can have
excellent voice but weak structure, or strong substance but poor project health.
Identifying which dimensions are strong and which are weak focuses editorial
energy where it matters most.

The scorecard is not a grade. It is a diagnostic instrument. A score of 3 on
structural integrity does not mean the book is "average" -- it means the
structure works but has identifiable weak spots that can be named and addressed.
The score points to the problem; the rubric describes the problem; the editorial
process fixes the problem.

## In Practice

### The Four Dimensions

#### 1. Voice Consistency (25%)

Voice consistency measures whether the prose sounds like one mind wrote it. In
fiction, this includes both the narrator's voice and the distinctness of
character voices. In nonfiction, it measures whether the author's persona is
stable across chapters. In memoir, it is the single most important dimension.

**What is evaluated:**
- Does the prose match the voice spec across all chapters?
- Are sentence rhythms, vocabulary level, and tonal register consistent?
- In fiction: are character voices distinct from each other and from the narrator?
- In nonfiction: is the epistemic stance consistent (how the author handles
  uncertainty, hedging, authority)?
- Are there detectable session seams where voice shifts without narrative
  motivation?

**Rubric:**

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1 | **No recognizable voice.** The prose reads as generic or machine-generated. No consistent personality on the page. Different chapters sound like different authors with no deliberate reason. |
| 2 | **Inconsistent.** A voice is present in places but drops out frequently. Session seams are visible. Character voices bleed into each other (fiction). Tonal register shifts without purpose. |
| 3 | **Mostly consistent with drift.** The voice is identifiable and works for most of the manuscript. Occasional passages feel off -- usually at chapter openings (session starts) or during complex scenes. Drift is correctable in a line edit pass. |
| 4 | **Consistent with minor lapses.** The voice is strong and sustained. Occasional word choices or sentence patterns break the pattern, but a reader would not notice without looking for them. Character voices are distinct (fiction). |
| 5 | **Unified and distinctive.** The voice is the book's signature. It is immediately recognizable, sustained without faltering, and could not belong to any other book. In fiction, each character's voice is a fingerprint. |

#### 2. Structural Integrity (25%)

Structural integrity measures whether the book's architecture holds. Does the
sequence of chapters create a coherent progression? Does the pacing curve work?
Do transitions between units feel motivated rather than arbitrary?

**What is evaluated:**
- Does the chapter order follow a defensible logic (chronological, thematic,
  argumentative, dramatic)?
- Does each chapter earn its position -- would moving it break something?
- Does the pacing curve have appropriate variation (Chapter 5)?
- Are transitions between chapters and between sections smooth?
- Does the book deliver on its opening promise by its conclusion?
- In fiction: do subplots converge? Are planted setups paid off?
- In nonfiction: does the argument build without logical gaps?

**Rubric:**

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1 | **No discernible structure.** Chapters could be reordered without the reader noticing. No arc, no progression, no cumulative build. The book is a collection of loosely related pieces. |
| 2 | **Structure present but broken.** An intended structure is visible but fails in execution. Major logical gaps (nonfiction), unresolved subplots (fiction), or pacing that sags for multiple chapters. The reader feels lost or bored for extended stretches. |
| 3 | **Structure works with weak spots.** The overall architecture is sound. The reader follows the progression. But specific transitions are rough, one or two chapters feel misplaced, or the pacing has a dead zone. Fixable with developmental editing. |
| 4 | **Solid with minor issues.** The structure is strong and purposeful. Chapter order feels inevitable. Pacing has good variation. Minor issues: a transition that could be smoother, a planted element that pays off a beat too late. |
| 5 | **Architecture is invisible.** The reader never questions why a chapter is where it is. The pacing feels natural. Every planted element pays off. Every transition is motivated. The structure serves the content so well that it disappears -- the reader experiences only the story or argument. |

#### 3. Substance (25%)

Substance measures the depth and quality of the book's content. Are characters
realized or merely sketched? Are arguments developed or merely asserted? Does
every chapter earn its place by adding something the book cannot do without?

**What is evaluated:**
- In fiction: are characters three-dimensional with wants, flaws, and arcs? Are
  the stakes real and escalating? Is the world internally consistent?
- In nonfiction: are claims supported by adequate evidence? Is the argument
  original or at least freshly articulated? Does the book give the reader
  something they cannot easily find elsewhere?
- In memoir: are episodes rendered with sensory specificity? Does the author's
  reflection add meaning beyond the events themselves?
- Across all types: does every chapter justify its existence? Could any chapter
  be cut without loss?

**Rubric:**

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1 | **Thin and superficial.** Characters are types, not people. Arguments are assertions without support. Episodes are summarized, not rendered. The book says obvious things or tells a story without depth. |
| 2 | **Functional but flat.** Characters serve the plot but lack interiority. Arguments have some evidence but lack nuance. The book does its job but does not linger in the reader's mind. |
| 3 | **Solid with gaps.** Most content is substantive. Characters have moments of real depth. Arguments are generally well-supported. But there are thin spots: a chapter that feels rushed, a character who disappears, an argument that relies on assertion where evidence was needed. |
| 4 | **Rich with minor weaknesses.** The content is consistently strong. Characters surprise the reader. Arguments engage counterpoints. Episodes resonate emotionally. Minor weaknesses: a secondary character who could be deeper, an example that does not quite land. |
| 5 | **Deeply satisfying.** The book rewards re-reading. Characters feel like people the reader knows. Arguments change the reader's mind. Episodes haunt. Every chapter is essential. The book achieves what it set out to do and leaves the reader altered. |

#### 4. Project Health (25%)

Project health measures the state of the system that supports the manuscript.
This dimension is unique to the Book_Map approach -- it recognizes that a
well-maintained production system leads to a better manuscript and that a
neglected system produces compounding quality problems.

**What is evaluated:**
- Is the voice spec current and detailed enough to guide any agent?
- Is the structure spec current and does it match the actual manuscript?
- Are character specs (fiction) or argument specs (nonfiction) maintained?
- Is the editorial tracker up to date?
- Are session handoffs complete with creative state fields?
- Is the editorial debt register maintained (known quality gaps tracked)?
- Are parking lot items catalogued rather than scattered?

**Rubric:**

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1 | **No system.** No specs, no plans, no tracker. The manuscript exists in isolation. Each session starts from scratch. There is no way to evaluate quality consistently because there are no criteria to evaluate against. |
| 2 | **System exists but neglected.** Specs were created but not updated. The editorial tracker is months out of date. Handoffs are sporadic. The system exists on paper but is not trusted or used. |
| 3 | **System maintained with gaps.** Core documents (voice spec, structure spec) are current. Some supporting documents (character specs, editorial tracker) have fallen behind. Handoffs are usually complete. The system works but requires catch-up maintenance. |
| 4 | **System well-maintained.** All specs are current. The editorial tracker reflects actual progress. Handoffs are complete and include creative state. The editorial debt register tracks known issues. The system supports productive sessions reliably. |
| 5 | **System pristine.** Every document is current, detailed, and useful. The editorial tracker is accurate to the current session. All specs have been updated to reflect decisions made during drafting. The parking lot is organized. An agent or author can find any piece of project information within 60 seconds. |

### Audit Rhythm

The scorecard is applied at two cadences:

**Full audit at each stage gate.** When a chapter completes a stage (draft done,
dev edit done, line edit done), score all four dimensions for that chapter. This
is the checkpoint that determines whether the chapter advances to the next stage
or returns for revision. A chapter must score 3 or higher on all four dimensions
to advance. Any dimension below 3 triggers targeted work on that dimension
before the chapter moves forward.

**Spot checks during drafting.** Every third drafting session, the agent
performs a quick self-assessment of the most recently completed unit. This is not
a full audit -- it is a pulse check. Score voice consistency and substance for
the unit just written. If either is below 3, flag it in the session handoff for
attention during the next editorial pass.

### Agent Self-Assessment

After completing a unit of work (scene or section), the agent scores the
relevant dimensions and includes the assessment in the exit ticket:

```markdown
## Quality Self-Assessment

| Dimension             | Score | Notes                                    |
|-----------------------|-------|------------------------------------------|
| Voice Consistency     | 4     | Strong match to spec. One paragraph in   |
|                       |       | the middle shifted register -- flagged.   |
| Structural Integrity  | 3     | Transition from previous unit is rough.   |
|                       |       | Needs smoothing in assembly.              |
| Substance             | 4     | Character moment in the climax lands      |
|                       |       | well. Could deepen the secondary          |
|                       |       | character's reaction.                     |
| Project Health        | 4     | Handoff complete. Updated continuity      |
|                       |       | bible with new facts.                     |
```

The self-assessment is honest, not generous. An agent that consistently rates
itself 5 across all dimensions is not producing excellent work -- it is
producing unreliable assessments. Self-assessment below 3 on any dimension is
a flag, not a failure. Flags are how the system catches problems before they
compound.

### The Editorial Debt Register

Not every quality issue can be fixed immediately. The editorial debt register
(`docs/editorial-debt-register.md`) tracks known quality gaps:

```markdown
# Editorial Debt Register

<!-- reviewed: 2026-02-13 -->

| ID  | Chapter | Dimension   | Score | Issue                          | Plan        |
|-----|---------|-------------|-------|--------------------------------|-------------|
| ED-1| Ch 3    | Voice       | 2     | Narrator shifts to distant     | Line edit   |
|     |         |             |       | third in bridge scene          | pass        |
| ED-2| Ch 5    | Substance   | 2     | Antagonist motivation thin     | Dev edit    |
|     |         |             |       |                                | revision    |
| ED-3| Ch 7-8  | Structure   | 3     | Transition between chapters    | Assembly    |
|     |         |             |       | is abrupt                      | smoothing   |
```

Debt is not shameful. Debt is tracked work that has a plan for resolution. The
danger is not having debt -- it is having untracked debt. Untracked quality
issues are invisible until a reader finds them. Tracked issues are scheduled
for repair.

## By Book Type

### Fiction

**Recommended weighting: Voice (30%), Structure (20%), Substance (30%),
Project Health (20%).**

Fiction lives and dies by voice and substance. A novel with impeccable structure
but flat characters and generic voice will not hold a reader. Conversely, a
novel with a magnetic voice and vivid characters can survive minor structural
imperfections. Weight the scorecard accordingly.

**Fiction-specific substance criteria:**
- Do characters make choices that are consistent with their established
  psychology but not predictable?
- Are there scenes that could only happen in this story (not generic "conflict
  scenes" or "romance scenes")?
- Does the dialogue reveal character, or does it merely convey information?
- Is the world consistent enough that the reader never breaks immersion to
  question a detail?

### Nonfiction

**Recommended weighting: Voice (15%), Structure (30%), Substance (35%),
Project Health (20%).**

Nonfiction depends most on having something worth saying (substance) and saying
it in a logical order (structure). Voice matters -- a distinctive voice makes
nonfiction readable rather than merely informative -- but it is secondary to the
argument's soundness and organization.

**Nonfiction-specific structure criteria:**
- Does each chapter's thesis follow from the previous chapter's conclusion?
- Is the evidence sequence persuasive? (Strongest evidence where the argument
  is most contested, not where the author happened to find it.)
- Are counterarguments addressed at the point where a skeptical reader would
  raise them?
- Does the book's conclusion follow from its chapters, or does it introduce
  claims not supported by the preceding material?

### Memoir

**Recommended weighting: Voice (35%), Structure (15%), Substance (30%),
Project Health (20%).**

Memoir is the most voice-dependent form. The reader is there for the author's
unique perspective on their own experience. Structure can be looser -- memoir
readers accept thematic organization, non-linear timelines, and associative
leaps that would confuse readers of nonfiction or genre fiction. Substance in
memoir is not about evidence but about rendered experience: specificity, sensory
detail, emotional honesty.

**Memoir-specific voice criteria:**
- Does the prose sound like a specific person, not a generic "memoirist"?
- Is the author's speaking rhythm preserved in the prose?
- Does the reflective voice (adult looking back) feel distinct from the
  experiencing voice (the person in the moment)?
- Are there passages where the author's natural idiom breaks through with
  particular force?

*The scorecard is not a judge. It is a mirror. It shows the manuscript what it
is, across dimensions that matter, with enough specificity to guide the next
round of editorial work. A book that scores well on the scorecard is not
guaranteed to be great -- but a book with undiagnosed weaknesses across multiple
dimensions is almost guaranteed to disappoint. Measure, diagnose, improve.*
